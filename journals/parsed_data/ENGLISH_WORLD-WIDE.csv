By contrast, the questions of whatcan be considered English, and how its outer boundaries are defined, have beenasked less frequently, and not in any comprehensive way. (In EWW I havefollowed a pragmatic editorial course in admitting varieties which have somelinguistic relationship with English and are in a contact situation/coexistence withEnglish in the speech community discussed.) My paper looks at a few &apos;problemcases&apos; among utterances, in particular at various forms of broken English andlinguistic experiments, at language mix and code-switching and then turns tolinguistic systems, with semi-languages, pidgins, creoles, cants and mixed languagessingled out for detailed discussion. A classification of the varieties treatedobviously depends on the degree of their divergence from English, their functionalrange and standardization, users&apos; attitudes and the ways how the language isacquired — four factors which can have different weight for the classification inthe individual case.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Mees,Spreading everwhere?: How Recent a Phenomenon is Glottalisation in Received Pronunciation?,1996,"There is no doubt that glottalisation of syllable-final stops in Received Pronunciation is on the increase, but this has sometimes been taken to imply that the feature has mushroomed as a late 20th-century phenomenon. This paper sets out to show that glottalisation is actually of some antiquity. Explicit references (by reputable linguists) to glottalisation in the standard language date from the early 1920s, while audio recordings going back even further provide us with direct proof. If apparent time is taken into account, such data could indicate that glottalisation was quite common from at least the mid-19th century onwards.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Kretzschmar, Jr.",Dimensions of Variation in American English Vocabulary,1996,"Vocabulary varies in more than just the single dimension of the list of words that appears in typical desk-size dictionaries. Attention to the multidimensional nature of lexical variation can contribute in important ways to our understanding of language, and more particularly to the situation of a language in its particular culture. The vocabulary of AmE has less to do with supposedly authoritative wordlists than it does with the the cultural, historical, regional, and social life of the country, and this can be illustrated from specialized dictionaries. A special focus of this essay is quantitative analysis. The features of a language may be con-sidered in terms of either magnitude or frequency, and such treatment has the potential to inform our understanding not only of a particular language, but of the workings of language taken more generally. Lexical variation is pervasive and normal: we should observe the interactions of the qualitative, quantitative, and structural dimensions of a language that promote the variation, and we should think differently about what a language is and how it works if we are to account for such behavior by words.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

It then focusses on a particular controversy surrounding the lyrics of a piece of dance hall music performed by Buju Banton. It argues that much of the discussion about the lyrics in Britain and the USA dealt with these lyrics outside the sociolinguistic context of the Jamaican dance hall within which Buju Banton&apos;s recorded performance would be understood by many Jamaicans to belong. The article further argues that the international misunderstanding is compounded by the fact that Jamaicans as a group refuse to recognise Jamaican, the language of the lyrics, as a language separate and apart from English. The conclusion is that if this were to happen, it would be easier to present Jamaican cultural output to the international community in a manner which forces that community to understand and respect the linguistic and sociocultural autonomy of such output. Since Jamaican (i.e. Jamaican Creole) is the language of dance hall performances, the article was written in Jamaican and an English translation provided. There is a brief discussion of the process by which a sociolinguistic academic article was conceived of and written in Jamaican, traditionally a language of oral informal discourse.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
10.1075/eww.17.1.02har,John Harris,ON THE TRAIL OF SHORT u,1996,"This article attempts a detailed reconstruction of recent developments in the history of English short u, the category that in southern English and its descendants shows up as a high vowel in PUT and a lowered vowel in CUT. Combining the comparative method with the interpretation of the historical documentary record, the exercise sets out to answer questions such as the following. At what stage did lowering result in a full-blown split between CUT and PUT? At what point did unrounding set in? Did lowering follow a peripheral or a central trajectory in vowel space? What mechanisms of change were involved — classically regular neogrammarian sound change or irregular lexical diffusion?The comparative aspect of the reconstruction draws heavily on vernacular Englishes which have emerged relatively recently in circumstances of large-scale language contact and shift, particularly those spoken in Ireland, West Africa and the Caribbean. The immediate significance of these varieties is that they emerged during a period when short u was in a state of considerable flux in the metropolitan language. The phonetic realisation and systemic organisation of the PUT and CUT vowels in these varieties offer certain direct insights into the history of short u that are no longer available in other dialects.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Because the fate of languages is closely related to the power of different groups in a society, this constitutional transition raises important issues of language and identity. At present English continues to play an important role in business and administration while Cantonese is the lingua franca of a highly cohesive and independent community. However, the extent to which the colonial language is a component of the Territory&apos;s identity, and the prospect of it retaining an influential role, remains to be seen. Reunification is likely to have a considerable impact on language attitudes and use with Putonghua, the official language of mainland China, emerging to challenge English and Cantonese as a high status language in public domains. This paper builds on previous studies by Pierson et al. (1980) and Pennington &amp; Yue (1994) to examine the changing language attitudes brought about by the handover. A questionnaire was administered to 900 Hong Kong undergraduates to discover students&apos; perspectives on language and cultural identity, social, affective and instrumental attitudes and general predictions for language use with a view towards the political transition.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Mapping the distribution of regional names for 67 items has identified four major dialect regions, two of which have sub-regions, as well as two minor sub-regions, and several local regions identified by only one or two words. A comparison with other English-speaking countries found several characteristics of regional variation unique to Australia, but also strong similarities to other previously colonised countries. The nature of regional variation in AusE has obscured the existence of previously unnoticed regional diversity within the well-known uniformity of the language.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Variation in the KIT vowel is studied in the conversation of a sociolinguistic sample of 60 speakers of NZE, structured by gender, ethnicity (Maori and Pakeha [Anglo]) and age. KIT realizations are scattered from close front through to rather low backed positions, although some phonetic environments favour fronter variants. All Pakeha and most Maori informants use centralized realizations most of the time, but some older Maori speakers use more close front variants. This group is apparently influenced by the realization of short /I/ in the Maori language, as these are also the only fluent speakers of Maori in the sample. Close front realizations of KIT thus serve as a marker of Maori ethnicity, while centralization marks general New Zealand identity. Centralized /I/ appears to have been established in NZE by the early 20th century",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

In the centuries that followed, statements underlining the link between national language and nation are few — even on the Celtic fringe. It was the American Revolution which gave birth to a new centre of anglophones proud of their independent standards; a similar development but with increasingly weaker results has affected Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. Second-language countries like India are trailing even further behind, not to mention the problems of creole communities like those in the Caribbean, West Africa or the Southwest Pacific. My paper looks at these communities for evidence of a correlation between linguistic and political independence, standardization and prestige associated with use of the vernacular, and discusses problems connected with the development of alternatives like the standardization of an indigenous language to serve as a badge of national prestige, and as an expression of democratic intentions.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper attempts to begin a dialog on the effects of methods on results in dialectology by comparing results from five surveys which overlap both in their geographic coverage and in some of the linguistic information they elicit. The surveys differ in their methods of administration (face-to-face interviews vs. telephone interviews), sample construction (purposive vs. random), and the kinds of data they elicit (observations of behavior vs. self-reports). Our comparison of the different surveys shows that while different modes of administration have little effect on results, even slight differences in survey populations affect results significantly, as does the kind of data elicited. Surprisingly, self-reports seem to reflect the linguistic behavior of a population for some features better than observations of behavior do. The effects of the type of sample used are not clear from this study, although random samples have the advantage of explicitly accounting for sampling error and allow for a wide range of inferential statistics that cannot be used with purposive samples. Finally, the comparison suggests that there is no single &apos;best&apos; type of survey. Different research problems require different kinds of surveys. What is important is that samples not be constructed in haphazard ways and that we explicitly take into account the effects of our methods on our results.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This article traces its local history and its failure to establish itself as a replacement for French (and perhaps also the French-based creole) during the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. English is still the official language of Mauritius, but a large proportion of the population does not speak it at all or has at best a very limited knowledge of it. Nonetheless, no other language spoken on the island presents itself as a viable alternative. The historical overview and the discussion of the present situation are complemented by an analysis of the language tables taken from the population censuses of 1931 to 1990 and some data from an inquiry made by the author in the mid-seventies. To complete the study, the English influence on French and Creole is shown, and three specimens of Mauritian English as spoken by young people are given and commented on.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

I will explore the myths in the context of IndE but the arguments provided apply to all the New Varieties. The myths I will deal with are:1) IndE is a ""non-native"" variety of English.2) IndE has no standards.3) IndE lacks creativity.4) IndE is the language of a small but dominant elite.5) English is the cause of most of the problems in India and in the world.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Horvath,From Accent to Marker in Cajun English: A Study of Dialect Formation in Progress,1998,"The English of bilingual Cajuns living in southern Louisiana has been described as an accented variety of English, the result of interference from French. In order to investigate this proposition, we present a variationist study of four features of Cajun English: 1) the interdental fricatives /th, ð7 realized by the dental stops [t, d]; 2) the failure to aspirate the stops /p, t, k/; 3) the monophthongization of /ai/ and 4) vowel nasalization. The data for this study are taken from the Cajun French/ English Sociolinguistic Survey; the survey has confirmed that English has become dominant in these communities over the last two generations. A sub-sample of 28 speakers, divided by gender into three age groups, is taken from St Landry Parish. If interference from French is the source of these features of Cajun English, we would expect a steady decrease in frequency over apparent time so that these vernacular features will be used more frequently by the older and less frequently by the middle-aged and least of all by the younger generation. The results of GoldVarb analysis of the variables show a complex interrelationship of age, gender and social network. All of the variables studied followed the expected pattern; the old generation use more of the vernacular variants than all others; the middle-aged dramatically decrease their use of the vernacular but the young generation exhibit a number of complex patterns in their use of the vernacular features. Interestingly the young follow the decreasing pattern for (p, t, k) but they show a level of usage for the other variables closer to the old generation so that there is a v-shaped age pattern rather than a pattern showing a steady decrease of the so-called accented features of Cajun English. We argue that although the vernacular forms produced by the older group can be considered part of an ethnic accent, they play a very different role in the younger generation which can be attributed both to French language attrition and to the on-going blossoming of a Cajun cultural renaissance. Being Cajun is now socially and economically advantageous; the younger generation, unlike the middle-aged, take pride in their Cajun identity. The functions of French for people under 40 years old have been significantly reduced so that it is now generally limited to the family domain and even more restricted in that it is used primarily in speaking with older members of the extended family. Given this situation, the only linguistic way to signal ""Cajunness"" is left to English.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

We suggest that this wh-construction is based on the imperative, and inherits the structural properties associated with the relatively more polite version of the imperative. In Singapore English, this is the version that makes explicit mention of the second person subject, whereas in Standard English the use of you in the imperative decreases politeness. After a careful comparison of the pragmatics of the imperative in Standard English, Singapore English and Chinese, we conclude that the asymmetry between the why-construction in Standard English and in Singapore English can be accounted for by substrate influence from Chinese, from which the Singaporean construction has inherited its politeness constraints.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The change originates in the east of Northern Ireland, especially Belfast, and may have been in progress for some time. It is entering DLE through the Protestant middle class, and diphthongs are now the predominant vernacular form among Protestant teenagers of both sexes and all class backgrounds. While it has made little progress among Catholics, it is currently found mainly among the Catholic middle class.

Data from the Australian ACE corpus (1986) is compared with (a) those from the American Brown corpus and the British LOB corpus (both 1961); and with (b) findings from an Australian elicitation survey of 1993. Both the diachronic corpus comparisons and the sociolinguistic profiles associated with the survey indicate declining use of the subjunctive in adverbial clauses, most notably the counterfactual type, but also those expressing purpose, concession and ordinary conditions. However the use of mandative subjunctives is stable, written into a range of corpus materials (fiction and non-fiction), and endorsed by Australians across the age range.

While A undergoes RP phonological rules to surface as A&apos;, B may fail to undergo these processes; it may also undergo parallel — and quite often divergent — processes and surface as B&apos;. For example, RP UR ""s[^]cceed"" (A) is restructured to CamE ""s[u]cceed"" (B). A becomes ""s[^]cceed"" by Vowel Reduction and B, which does not undergo this process, surfaces unchanged as ""s[u]cceed"" (B&apos;). This process can be represented on a chart which has three sides: AA&apos;, AB and BB&apos;. Hence the name Trilateral Process. It is observed that this model is more illuminating with respect to the dynamics of the differences between native and non-native Englishes than an analysis based solely on surface observation of deviations, for a catalogue of deviations lacks the explanatory insights of a trilateral analysis.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The sociolinguistic matrix is described by outlining the distribution of the main functions of the two written languages standard written Chinese (SWC) and English, and the three spoken languages Cantonese, English and Putonghua, in four key domains: government, media, employment and education. Cantonese and English remain the most important spoken languages. The macro-sociolinguistic analysis ""diglossia without bilingual-ism"" has given way to polyglossia with increasing bilingualism. There are two written H varieties, SWC and English, the former is penetrating into some domains formerly dominated by the latter. Cantonese, typically interspersed with some English, is assigned L functions in both spoken and written mediums. There is some indication that Putonghua is getting increasingly important in post-colonial Hong Kong, but there are as yet no significant social functions assigned to it. Compared with the early 1980s, significant changes have taken place at all levels. Language-related changes are discussed in light of a critical review of recent local research in a number of areas: medium of instruction, language right, linguistic imperialism, Hong Kong accent, Hong Kong identity and language attitudes toward Chinese and English. In view of the tremendous social prestige and symbolic predominance of English, it is argued that ""value-added"" is a more suitable epithet than ""auxiliary"" to characterize the status of English in post-1997 Hong Kong.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Because of numerous social changes, region is no longer the primary determinant of language variation, and contemporary (sociolinguistic) dialectology has expanded the number of independent variables. In Dialect Topography, we survey a representative population, and that population inevitably includes some subjects born outside the survey region. We want to know how these non-natives affect language use in the community. Admitting them thus requires us to implement some mechanism for identifying them in order to compare their language use to the natives. The mechanism is called the Regionality Index (RI). Subjects are ranked on a scale from 1 to 7, with the best representatives of the region (indigenes) receiving a score of 1, the poorest (interlopers) a score of 7, and subjects of intermediate degrees of representativeness in between. I look at three case studies in which RI is significant: bureau in Quebec City, running shoes in the Golden Horseshoe, and soft drink in Quebec City. These results introduce a new dimension to the study of language variation as a regional phenomenon and provide a framework for the integration of regionality as one independent variable among many in dialect studies. The RI provides, perhaps for the first time, an empirical basis for inferring the sociolinguistic effects of mobility.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

It is suggested that the structural and functional constituents of these varieties can be accounted for by either of two processes, labelled diffusion (the largely unmodified transmission of earlier forms of English (dialectal and standard) through space and time), and selection (the choice of a new, typically indigenous item in a process of feature competition under language contact conditions); some tentative properties of these processes are discussed.

Analysis of nearly 800 contexts of use reveals that this variation is entirely conditioned by linguistic internal constraints. The most significant of these is person and number of the subject — 3rd person singular subjects and plural NPs have no do absence, while do is variable in the remaining pronouns. I argue that a syntactic explanation best accounts for this patterning of use. Where there is no overt -s inflection in the present tense (influenced by the “northern subject rule”), do is not obligatory in Buckie Scots. Frequency effects, lexical restrictions and processing constraints are called upon to account for the range of frequencies of do absence seen in the variable contexts. Lastly, there is no significant change in use of do across three generations of speakers, highlighting the community members’ relative immunity to prescriptive norms.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This variable is of special interest because, although phoneticians have noted that English speakers sometimes produce this sound in different ways (MacKay 1987: 98; Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996), the sociolinguistic literature does not mention (s) as a variable, apart from references to the homosexual community (Taylor 1998). The findings show that males and females in the majority New Zealand European community use different proportions of the fronted variant of (s), and that minority ethnic groups align themselves around these gender differences in various ways.

Three types of development were possible:1. individual RS items might survive (and possibly acquire new meanings);2. they might die out, leaving a historical record of their extraterritorial existence at best;3. they might prompt local fashions, imitating the pattern but creating new words.The phenomenon of RS has found various references in books on national Englishes (such as those by Baker (1970), but significantlyless so in Ramson (1966) and Mencken (1977)); however, it has never been explored on a contrastive level. Such an approach hasbecome more feasible today now that the set of historical dictionaries of English is complete following the publication of the worksedited by Silva (1996), Ramson (1988) and Orsman (1997) — even though slang is badly documented, since it was notalways considered worthy of inclusion in general dictionaries.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The findings are assessed with respect to similar fronting patterns in the vowel systems of varieties of English elsewhere in the UK and worldwide, and to the principles of sound change elucidated by Labov (1991, 1994).

Both the native English and the non-native speakers use vague language extensively in our data for a similar range of purposes, for example to achieve informal communication, classify objects, fill a lexical or knowledge gap, and accommodate one another. We also investigated whether communication problems are experienced in these intercultural conversations by speakers using vague language differently. We conclude that in our data at least there is no evidence to suggest that such communication problems arise from differences in vague language use.

Among educated NigP speakers, borrowing from English is a common strategy, but broadcasters who translate news from English into NigP have to produce a form of the language that will be intelligible to a target audience whose command of English is limited. The paper offers a discussion of this problem based on a corpus of spoken NigP comprising news and several other text categories. Text samples from the news texts are analysed, and corpus data illustrating Anglicisms and pidginization on the lexical, grammatical and discourse levels are discussed. In addition, the results of an elicitation experiment in which Nigerian informants were asked to evaluate extracts from the corpus by means of a questionnaire are reported. The news texts were found to be less satisfactory than others, and it is argued that this is due not only to Anglicisms but in some cases also to an overuse of pidginization strategies. However, there are also examples of successful adaptation of an English script, and it is argued that even with only a moderate degree of language engineering, one could build on such achievements to make NigP a more viable medium of news broadcasting.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Tagliamonte; Jennifer Smith,“Either it isn’t or it’s not”: neg/aux contraction in British dialects,2002,"The source dialects in Britain are critical to disentangling the history and development of varieties in North America and elsewhere. One feature which appears to provide a critical diagnostic, particularly for situating dialects geographically in Britain, is negative (neg) vs. auxiliary (aux) contraction with be, have and will. Use of aux contraction is said to be more prevalent in northern varieties. Using the comparative method and quantitative methodology, this paper provides a quantitative analysis of this feature in eight British communities, two in the south, six in more northern areas. The comparative cross-variety approach provides a number of different lines of evidence which can then be used for testing similarities and differences across varieties. First, there is a dramatic difference between neg/aux contraction with be compared to the other auxiliaries that is consistent across all the communities. In every location be has aux contraction, and in each case it has higher rates of aux contraction than will or have. Second, all the Scots varieties have categorical aux contraction with be, just as would be expected from the historical record. However, there is a marked difference across the same varieties with will. Third, in the four locales where there is variation between neg and aux contraction the choice of form can be explained by the influence of the preceding phonological environment. In sum, neg/aux contraction is a poor diagnostic for distinguishing varieties of British English on broad geographic grounds. In contrast, at other levels of grammar (morphology and syntax) there are broad similarities across northern varieties. We conclude that the type of linguistic feature targeted for investigation plays a critical role in determining the similarities and differences amongst varieties.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The findings reveal that English, a co-official language of the country, is gradually entering the home environment, where the indigenous languages are expected to dominate; it is the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools, and of religion and the court as pastors and lawyers consistently use it in their respective trades; in short it is the means of expression of educated people, the elite of the land. However, English finds itself in a situation of competition with other languages in this territory. At a lower level, it has to compete with Pidgin English, a contact language which dominates the neighbourhood domain. At a higher level, it competes with French, the other official language, which is dominant in tertiary level education, in the media (where most newspapers as well as most foreign radio and cable television programmes are in it), in public places (where respondents report overhearing talks and reading notices in tongues other than English), and in the civil service (where most official correspondences are initiated in it).

The existence of the three varieties is confirmed by the data. The common performance features include a tendency to stress more syllables in words than the native speaker.

The paper therefore attempts to describe and explain differences in the use of the modals between authoritative accounts of Standard English on the one hand and the informal spoken English of a sample of speakers from Tyneside on the other. I argue that the reason for these differences may be in part due to increased markedness (systemic, sociolinguistic and stylistic) of certain forms, which induces simplification (the (re)creation of regularity within the system, through focussing) and redistribution (where modalities previously expressed by certain modal verbs come to be expressed by other modals within the system). Throughout, I try to suggest an approach to variation which considers language-internal and language-external factors.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The present paper revisits some aspects of these studies and presents a sort of pronunciation atlas on the basis of some selected features. But more importantly, the paper examines how these features are formed. It considers, but goes beyond, the over-used theory of mother-tongue interference, and analyses a wide range of other factors: colonial input, shared historical experience, movement of populations, colonial and post-colonial opening to other continents, the psychological factor, speakers’ attitudes towards the various models of pronunciation in their community, etc. For example, the Krio connection accounts for some striking similarities between Nigerian, Sierra Leonean and Gambian Englishes despite the wide geographical distance between them. The positive perception of their accent, which they judge superior to the other West African accents, has, in the past three decades, shaped the English pronunciation of Ghanaians in a particular way. The northward movements of populations have disseminated to East Africa some typically Southern African features. Links between Southern and East Africa, and Asia, are reflected in the presence of some Asian features in East and Southern African Englishes. The paper shows how African accents of English result from the interaction between the influence of indigenous languages and Africans’ exposure to several colonial and post-colonial Englishes.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Roderick Walters,“Celtic English”: Influences on a South Wales valleys accent,2003,"The article examines the phonology of Rhondda Valleys English, an accent of the Welsh “Valleys”, to try to discover to what degree it is influenced by the Welsh language. It finds some features of segmental phonology which appear to be direct transfers. However, most of these appear to be recessive, since they are found mostly in the speech of older generations born at a time when there was considerably more Welsh spoken in the Rhondda than at present. The article lists other non-standard features of segmental phonology where parallel sounds exist in the Welsh language, but it cannot be stated with certainty that Welsh is the primary source. In such cases, the Welsh substratum may be acting at least to reinforce the presence of the features concerned. Finally, the article looks at the suprasegmentals (prosody) of Rhondda Valleys English. Here, because the similarities with the Welsh language are so striking and there are no obvious parallels with neighbouring dialects of England, it would seem very likely that most of the features concerned constitute direct transfers. Since such Welsh-language derived suprasegmental features seem more pervasive than the segmental ones, they may well form the strongest and most enduring “Celtic imprint” on the dialect studied.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The origins of this feature are not easy to pinpoint, and some theories (Macafee 1997, for example) even point to Glasgow, though not without controversy. It is, nevertheless, spreading rapidly throughout Scotland in predictable patterns along the lines of social class, age and sex (Macaulay 1991; Stuart-Smith 1999; Romaine 1982). This paper presents some of the findings from a recent study of pronunciation changes in rural Aberdeenshire (north-east Scotland). The data confirm the spread of the glottal stop in this area in apparent time. In addition to this, there is an interesting pattern visible. While all of the other phonetic variables in this study show remarkable similarity of patterning across age, the glottal stop shows a different distribution.

We examine this hypothesis by considering the sociolinguistic situation in Texana, North Carolina, a small African American community in the Smoky Mountain region of Appalachia. Though its population is only about 150 residents, it is the largest African American community in the Smoky Mountains. This study considers diagnostic sociolinguistic variables for Texana residents in order to examine the extent to which the members of this African American community align their speech with local dialect norms as the basis for evaluating the status of earlier and contemporary African American English (AAE) in Appalachia. Morphosyntactic variables examined are 3rd pl. -s attachment, 3rd sg. -s absence, copula absence, and past tense be leveling; phonological variables include rhoticity, syllable coda consonant cluster reduction, and /ai/ glide weakening. When compared to cohort white Appalachian speakers, data from older Texana residents confirm the regional accommodation of earlier AAE and at the same time point toward substrate influence in the historical development of AAE. However, unlike AAE in other enclave regional contexts, we find that the dialect of younger residents is not moving toward a supraregional norm of AAE. Instead, young speakers are accommodating several key features of Southern American English, specifically the Southern Appalachian English (AppE) variety that is characteristic of the Smoky Mountain region of North Carolina. Explanations for the attested diachronic changes as well as future trajectories of change for Texana speakers must appeal to sociopsychological factors such as regional identity and orientation to explain local community language norms.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Before British colonisation of Ireland, the NSR was present in dialects of Northern England and the North Midlands, regions which contributed substantially to English settlement in the South of Ireland.

This paper describes the syntactic variation found in this variety of English. It presents the results of analyses of a corpus containing 22 hours of naturally occurring interactions and describes both unsystematic as well as (seemingly) systematic grammatical choices made by the speakers. The results reveal that, not unlike the processes which have previously been documented for dialect contact, interactions across international Englishes are characterised by processes of levelling and regularisation, whilst at the same time individual speakers retain the characteristics of their original varieties. Individual Englishes are further constrained by transfer processes and interlanguage patterns.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

In addition to describing aspects of Tibeto-Burman Indian English, a previously unreported Indian English variety, I also examine how and why this variety of English differs from General Indian English. The English of Tibeto-Burman L1 speakers seems to form a variety distinct from Indian English, most noticeably in terms of the lack of retroflexion of coronal consonants, the devoicing of word-final obstruents, the simplification of consonant clusters, the presence of post-vocalic [p], and the reduced set of vowel contrasts. Most of these can be traced to transfer from the L1 phonology, with the coda devoicing and cluster reductions reflecting simplification in terms of markedness, following developmental sequences found in second language acquisition.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

We note that these uses correspond to the pragmatic category of “givenness/familiarity”, and may also be associated with the notions “near/close”.

Black South African English (BlSAfE). Most writing on the topic has been content to supply lists of non-standard features which are thought to be diagnostic of the variety. This paper aims to characterise the syntax of the variety via its recurrent properties, rather than as a superset of unrelated features. In this regard I use the cover term “anti-deletion” for three relatable properties: (a) restoring a feature that tends to be deleted in modern standard English, e.g. the infinitive marker to in She made me to go; (b) retaining, rather than deleting elements that are known to be deleted in some (non-standard) varieties of English, e.g. retention rather than deletion of the copula; and (c) inserting additional grammatical morphemes into the standard English structure, e.g. cross-clausal double conjunctions like although… but. The concept of an anti-deletion allows one to characterise one of the two systems that underlie BlSAfE, the other being the standard syntax of the Target Language (TL). More generally, the notion of “anti-deletion” can be used fruitfully in characterising the syntax of individual second language varieties of English on a continuum.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

In attempting to describe the verb-complementational profile of Indian English, we offer a pilot study which combines a descriptive aim and a methodological aim. At the descriptive level, the present article focuses on ditransitive verbs and their complementation and addresses two related questions: (1) To what extent do the frequency and distribution of complementation patterns of specific ditransitive verbs (e.g. give) differ between Indian English and British English? (2) To what extent is the basic ditransitive pattern with two object noun phrases (e.g. in he sent Mary his warmest wishes) associated with different verbs in British English and Indian English? The present paper reveals that in both regards there are clear and identifiable differences in verb complementation between the two varieties. At the methodological level, this pilot study combines the use of balanced and representative subcorpora from the International Corpus of English (ICE) with the in-depth analysis of a much larger database that has been extracted from the Internet archive of the daily Indian newspaper The Statesman. This makes it possible to also detect examples of low-frequency constructions in Indian English, e.g. sporadic cases of ditransitive complementation of verbs such as advise, gift and impart.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Thirteen young speakers from north-east, east and central China were recorded reading a passage and participating in a short interview, and their pronunciation is analyzed. The most salient features of their speech include the use of an epenthetic vowel after word-final plosives especially before another word beginning with a consonant, avoidance of reduced vowels especially in function words, heavy nasalization of vowels preceding a final nasal consonant, substitution of [s] for /θ/ and [z] or [d] for /ð/, use of [x] for /h/, and emphasis on sentence-final pronouns.

Using a questionnaire, it gauged the extent of acceptability of twenty-six features by between 75 and 188 respondents. The twenty-six features appeared in sentences that would be considered as deviant in standard international English, and informants were instructed to correct errors in them. The sample of respondents was drawn, over a two-year period, from eight classes of students specializing in either linguistics or communication at the University of Nairobi. The target features covered “grammar” in its widest sense: from punctuation marks and spelling to morphological, syntactic and lexical aspects. The results showed that fourteen (i.e. 54%) of the twenty-six structures scored acceptability ratings of at least 60%. These could be argued to be indeed characteristic of at least written Kenyan English. But, with acceptability ratings for some other structures being as low as only two and eighteen percent, the results equally suggest that some apparently very common features of Kenyan English would only be accepted in spoken, rather than written language.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

An analysis of the speech of 150 educated Cameroon Pidgin speakers, randomly selected, shows that such phonological processes as heavy infiltration of sounds from indigenous Cameroonian languages, rampant consonant cluster simplification through vowel epenthesis and other segmental peculiarities which characterized Cameroon Pidgin by 1960, as depicted in Schneider (1960), are by far less perceivable in current Cameroon Pidgin usage. It is demonstrated that the feeling that Pidgin is an inferior language has caused Cameroon Pidgin speakers to opt for the “modernization” of the language using English language canons, instead of preserving the state of the language as it was in the yesteryears. It is therefore predicted that Cameroon Pidgin and Cameroon English will sooner or later be in a continuum.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper begins with a review of published comment from the late nineteenth century to the present on the Maori presence in the New Zealand English lexicon, and then introduces a corpus-based study of that presence from 1850 to 2000. The corpus produced was the largest yet assembled for the study of New Zealand English. Findings confirmed diachronic changes in the number of Maori word tokens and types used, in the nature of Maori words used, and claims that Maori loanwords have entered New Zealand English in two distinct waves.

Because the rhetorical structure of the L1 of these learners is not the same as that of English, what is written in these settings often exhibits features that do not meet the expectation of a typical western mind. This study analyses the structural configuration and some syntactic features that characterise students’ essays in a formal academic situation in Cameroon. The corpus is composed of 104 essays written by two batches of students (2002/2003, 2003/2004 academic years) in the department of English of the Ecole Normale Supérieure Yaoundé. Findings reveal that the structure of most essays examined does not follow the strict logical sequence that is characteristic of the typical English essay. And this may well reflect the narrative style that is foreign to the English native speaker. Again, there is a general tendency of register “mixing” in most of the essays. The article concludes that expository writing in Cameroon may well constitute a fruitful area of research into aspects of “nativization” of cohesion and rhetorical strategies of English in the “Outer Circle”.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The numerically dominant relativizer that is shown to be strongly conditioned by the grammatical function of the relative marker as well as being favoured by indefinite and inanimate antecedent heads. The zero variant is similarly sensitive to syntactic function, and is preferentially selected in non-subject position. Furthermore, the selection of zero relatives is found to be highly constrained by clause length. Cross-variety comparison of the results with previous research on other English dialects suggests that not only are there nuanced differences in the choice of relative marker, but that there are possibly construction-specific differences constraining the choice of specific variants.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper considers the evidence for these two distinct processes of L‑vocalization in Glaswegian, drawing on empirical evidence from two corpora of Glaswegian collected in the early 1980s and late 1990s. The results from the later corpus confirm the vigorous maintenance of the Scots l‑vocalization, but at the same time provide clear indications of the incorporation of innovative L‑vocalization.

Unstressed periphrastic do, the feature under investigation, is used as a tense carrier and marker of habituality in Southwestern dialects and — in a more restricted context — in Irish English (IrE). Modern NVE shows only traces of periphrastic do. All of these uses are (a) of IrE origin and (b) recessive (cf. e.g. Clarke 2004b: 305). If all settlers had used the feature at the time they emigrated to Newfoundland, it is extremely unlikely that it should have been lost in NVE, one of the most conservative varieties of English, but maintained, at least to a certain extent, in the much less conservative modern varieties of SW English and IrE. This paper suggests possible stages of the life of periphrastic do in Newfoundland. With the help of evidence from literature on SW English dialects from the 19th and 20th centuries, it is argued that it is unlikely that all settlers were do users when arriving in Newfoundland. Moreover, a competing variant, generalized verbal ‑s, a pattern typical of NVE to the present day, existed in some of the settlers’ grammars (both SW English and IrE). It is assumed that periphrastic do, if it ever existed in NVE in those uses typical of SW English dialects, has been eradicated through contact with dialects that either used generalized ‑s or a more standard system.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The next part of the analysis discusses the patterns of interaction of rules in NigE, addressing issues like ordering of rules, feeding and bleeding. The third part highlights the behaviour of NigE in relation to the existing rules of English; it thus acknowledges that NigE shares many existing rules of English phonology. But more importantly it shows that NigE applies other rules differently (either more generally, partially, or inordinately) and that some of its rules are altogether new when perceived in terms of the standard accents of Inner Circle Englishes. The conclusion of the study shows, inter alia, that the findings can be used very fruitfully to provide further, alternative, and arguably more convincing explanations and interpretations of many facts of NigE and related Englishes.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

On the other hand, findings on the intonation of some non-native English varieties, Nigerian English (Gut 2003, 2005) and Indian English (Gumperz 1982) for example, suggest that speakers of these varieties of English rarely deaccent given information in the discourse structure, hence making both types of information prominent. This study reports findings of the analyses of the intonational marking of the two types of information in Cameroon English (CamE). Data from two speaking styles, the Passage Reading Style (PRS) and the Conversational Style (CS), were analysed both auditorily and acoustically. Results show that, unlike speakers of some other non-native varieties of English, Cameroon English speakers make new information more prominent than given information in the discourse structure. As for how Cameroon English speakers acoustically implement the intonational marking of new and given information, the findings further reveal that they make more use of intensity and duration than of other acoustic parameters like high pitch accent (H*), findings which are somewhat dissimilar to those documented in native varieties of English whereby the most obvious acoustic correlate of new information in discourse is the high pitch accent (H*).",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Building on a longitudinal research program on (spoken) English dialect corpora, the present investigation examines data from a 1.5 million word corpus of the indigenous population of Toronto, Canada, the country’s largest urban centre. Variation analysis reveals that the system of obligation/necessity in this community has undergone nearly complete specialization to have to. Moreover, a comparison of these results with earlier studies suggests that the underlying system is organized differently than elsewhere.

10.1075/eww.29.3.02mil,Robert McColl Millar,The origins and development of Shetland dialect in light of dialect contact theories,2008,"Shetland dialect, the northernmost Scots variety, is something of a conundrum. Although most of its features place it at the end of the Northern Scots dialect continuum, some lexical, phonological and structural features resemble characteristics of more southerly Scots dialects; in particular those of the east central counties and the North-East. This essay approaches this problem from the point of view of recent work on new dialect formation, demonstrating that many of the features associated with this phenomenon — koinéisation, focussing, and the founder effect, among others — can be postulated for the development of Shetland dialect. Because this new dialect was formed further back in time than those previously studied, the pattern of development is rather more complex and difficult to describe than for those formed in the 19th century; moreover, the developing Scots dialect was for a lengthy period in contact with its close relative Norn in the islands. Because of the latter’s associations with local identity, indeed, we could see this as a further founder effect. The essay demonstrates that present-day Shetland dialect was formed in the early 19th century from the supraregional koiné of the original 16th and 17th century Scots-speaking settlers and the heavily Norn-influenced Scots of the first and second generations of islanders who no longer had Norn as a mother tongue.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper examines 67 linguistic features of a corpus of BlSAfE student writing, the Tswana Learner English Corpus (TLE), in comparison to a Standard English reference corpus, the Louvain Corpus of Native English Speaking Students (LOCNESS), within the framework of Biber’s (1988) multidimensional model, to determine if evidence for indigenisation and systematicity exists. Linguistic features that occur more frequently in LOCNESS than the TLE suggest that LOCNESS is characterised by greater elaboration of information and information density, more syntactically complex subordination, more reference cohesion and more specialised meanings. The TLE shows evidence of greater involvement of reader and writer of the text, although some features of informality also occur in LOCNESS. Based on comparison of the coefficients of variation in the two corpora, it is concluded that they exhibit similar ranges of variation and that variety status cannot be denied to BlSAfE on the grounds of variability. The application of the multidimensional model shows that the reference corpus, LOCNESS, is similar to academic writing in four of the six dimensions, but differs in being more involved in style and more overtly persuasive. Superficially, the TLE appears to be quite similar to LOCNESS in terms of the various dimensions, but closer examination reveals a number of differences, which largely confirm the findings that were made on the basis of individual feature comparisons: The TLE carries a lower informational density, and information is more often presented in hypothetical ways. It shows a number of similarities with the style and the information processing strategies attributed to spoken registers, but it still remains very clearly distinguishable from spoken language. Many similarities between the corpora are observed, which should be attributed to the register features of student writing. The paper concludes that there is sufficient evidence to acknowledge BlSAfE as a variety of English, on the ground of the stylistic differences between the TLE and LOCNESS, particularly its greater interpersonal as opposed to informational focus, as well as discourse-functional differences in the use of linguistic forms.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The first is the semantic function of the “relative past” and its relation to the unmarked verb, and the second is the discourse functions of the relative past marker and the unmarked verb. This paper addresses two issues related to this debate. Using fieldwork data from Belizean Creole, I present a qualitative analysis of tense usage in discourse focusing on the role of the inherent lexical aspect (aktionsart) of predicates. I examine how two different notions of past meaning are distributed between marked and unmarked verbs with different aktionsarten. I also look at the discourse function of these verbs in the contexts of the meanings expressed. I argue that an analysis of both the aktionsarten of the verbs and discourse factors are critical to developing an understanding of the range of meanings and functions of both the relative past marker and the unmarked verb. The paper also presents a new approach to the study of temporal reference in creoles.

At the same time, however, their SMSes also contain local linguistic features and, in particular, local, cultural content. The isiXhosa messages differ markedly from the writers’ English-language messages in that they contain no abbreviated material, non-standard spellings or paralinguistic restitutions and thus violate the sociolinguistic maxims of SMS / texting as postulated by Thurlow (2003).

The Thai speakers had lived in Australia for an average of 3.2 years. While the Thai speakers did not differ significantly from the AusE speakers in their vowel quality for monophthongs, they were more dissimilar in their production of diphthongs. Specifically, the Thai speakers produced English diphthongs with less formant movement, a phenomenon widely reported for speakers of various other Southeast Asian languages. Differences between the Thai and AusE groups reached statistical significance for the female speakers. As for temporal characteristics, the Thai speakers produced significantly shorter monophthongs, but not diphthongs, than did AusE speakers. As a result, the ratio of monophthongs to diphthongs was much smaller for the Thai (0.53) than for the AusE group (0.72). It appeared that the Thai speakers equated the English diphthongs /eI/ and /o~/ with the long vowels /e˜/ and /o˜/, respectively, in their first language (L1) Thai. Further, their production of the diphthongs may be related to a large number of diphthongs in the Thai vowel inventory, which may encourage its speakers to substitute existing L1 categories for English diphthongs rather than forming authentic, new phonetic categories.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper examines the impact of two globally available linguistic resources — the quotatives be like and go — in two spatially discontinuous localities. The investigation of the local processes that are involved in the adoption and negotiation of these global newcomers provides a holistic as well as a particularized view on the sociolinguistic mechanisms of globalization. I will demonstrate that by way of creatively adapting linguistic innovations, speakers can participate in global trends, yet do so in a highly localized and idiosyncratic manner. A micro-linguistic analysis of the emerging local practises allows us to situate localized linguistic processes into a “wider picture of structural becoming” (Blommaert 2003: 613), and provides one step forward towards our understanding of the development and/or maintenance of social spatiality.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Despite descriptions elsewhere of the PP as marginal to AAE, it occurs here with great frequency, a finding attributed to the sensitivity of the form to genre differences. The linguistic factors conditioning choice between the PP and the preterite match those described for other varieties of English of that time period.

The intellectual history of the situation provides a reasonable explanation. Linguists lack consensus themselves, while the public consensus includes inherent contradictions. Academic and public ideas of language came into conflict over Ebonics in part because linguists attempted to impose their own ideas on the public, in part because of confusion over terminology, and in part because the situation was entangled in social politics.

Hor has been described as an attenuator of illocutionary force, which is used to convert statements and commands into questions and requests. We provide a new observation that it can also be used as a booster of illocutionary force to make strong statements and demands. We claim that these paradoxical properties are consequences of hor’s nature to mark a nonstandard discourse context in which there is an asymmetry in epistemic or deontic authority between speaker and hearer vis-à-vis a proposition. In a context where epistemic / deontic authority for a proposition lies with the speaker, hor serves as a booster of illocutionary force.

Based on a corpus of spoken educated Singapore English, it is investigated whether the lack of past tense marking in verbs in a past tense context is due primarily to morphological or phonological factors and whether word frequency influences the rate of past tense marking.

Inspired by Schneider’s (2007) innovative “Dynamic Model”, the article examines textual and statistical data derived from a range of hitherto unexploited archival sources, including a historical corpus of English-language newspapers, confidential Colonial Office correspondence, and government records. Changes in the size and composition of the English-language speech community are tracked through a diachronic analysis of government censuses, school enrolments, lists of jurors, and letters to the press. The results of this analysis support Schneider’s contention that the 1960s marked an important turning point in Hong Kong’s linguistic history in that it presaged a substantial, education-driven increase in the numbers and proportion of English users in the territory. Despite the significant expansion of the English-using community in the past four decades, the dominant theme of public discourse about English has been that of “declining standards”. While the existence of a “complaint tradition” accords with the predictions of the Dynamic Model, it is perhaps not widely known that this tradition is a long-standing one.

While a robust literature exists about vowel shifting, vowel quality, and the sociolinguistic significance of vowels, comparable literature is lacking for the acoustic quality of liquids. This study seeks to supplement the acoustic studies of vowels by analyzing characteristics of the liquid /l/ in its word-initial context. Traditionally, phonologists have subdivided /l/ into two allophones: dark and light, although current analysis has characterized these distinctions as gradient, not discrete. Word-initial /l/ is thought to be the canonically lightest variant of the phoneme, but cross-dialectal research has shown great acoustic variance in its phonetic realization. This case study aims to trace the phoneme through three generations of Chicano English speakers from South Texas, and to draw conclusions about how its variation among speakers and generations can shed light on other sociolinguistic phenomena, such as the persistence of substrate features from Spanish (with its characteristically light /l/s) or assimilation into mainstream American English dialects (with their characteristically dark /l/s). The study shows that there is indeed significant shift in the lightness of /l/ — independent of phonetic context — across the generations of speakers under examination. This result supports other studies that show notable assimilation with Anglo English varieties in earlier generations, but robust use of ethnically-marked phonological features among recent generations.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

I propose that, in order to reach a thorough understanding of how the unique combination of grammatical features that define specific Asian Englishes come about, we must approach these features from a typological and evolutionary perspective which allows us to contrast them not only with Standard English varieties but also with the Asian languages with which these come into contact. As restructured vernaculars, Asian English varieties are de facto contact languages, and, as such, evolve as a consequence of selection of features from a multilingual pool. In this pool, features of Asian varieties play a significant role in determining the output grammar and must therefore be appreciated in their own right. In order to illustrate these points, I introduce an evolutionary view of contact language formation, and I present a set of features typical of Singlish, which are all instances of replication of Asian, not English, features",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Yet there is no work which systematically explores how these morphosyntactic typological differences are revealed in Hong Kong English (HKE). This paper explores how a typological perspective facilitates an analysis of the expression of finiteness in HKE, a significant feature because it subsumes a number of other typological facts.

Comparing Indian English and Singapore English, I examine three proposed candidates for English universals (Kortmann and Szmrecsanyi 2004), all of which show some presence in the two varieties — past tense omission, over-extension of the progressive, and copula omission. Past tense omission is found to be genuinely similar in the two varieties and accounted for by typological parallels in the substrates, whereas progressive morphology use and copula omission are found to be divergent in the two varieties and accounted for by typological differences in the substrates. All three variable systems are explicable as substrate-superstrate interactions, tempering claims of universality in both distribution and explanation.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

In several Asian contexts, one typological feature that is prominent in the multilingual contact situation (the “ecology”) is tone. Given that tone is recognized as an areal feature and is acquired easily by languages in contact, the question that arises is how this is manifested in the prosody of these New Englishes. Recent work has shown that contact languages, including English varieties, evolving in an ecology where tone languages are present do indeed combine aspects of tone languages. This paper attempts to go a step further, in suggesting not only that such varieties should not be viewed as aberrant in comparison to “standard” English but recognized as having their own prosodic system partly due to substrate typology, but also that in the consideration of New Englishes — here, Asian (but also African) Englishes — the traditional view of English as a stress / intonation language need to be revisited and revised, to consider some New Englishes as tone languages. Singapore English (SgE) is presented as a case in point, with the presence of tone demonstrated in the set of SgE particles acquired from Cantonese, at the level of the word, as well as in the intonation contour which moves in a series of level steps.

Among the features investigated are the use of competing collocations such as play a role and play a part, the noun complementation of collocations (HAVE + INTENTION + of -ing vs. to + infinitive), and non-L1 (or “new”) prepositional verbs such as comprise of, demand for or emphasize on.

In contrast to previous studies into verb complementation in New Englishes, we start off from three basic constructions in English — the intransitive, the monotransitive and the ditransitive construction — and analyse the co-occurrences of the three constructions and a wide range of verbs. The present study is based on the Hong Kong, the Indian, and the Singapore components of the International Corpus of English (ICE) because the three varieties represent markedly different stages in the process of the evolution of New Englishes with British English as the historical input variety. Our quantitative analysis includes multiple distinctive collexeme analyses for the different varieties. The results show, inter alia, that, firstly, processes of structural nativisation of New Englishes can also be observed at the level of verb-construction associations, which can be subsumed under the notion of “collostructional nativisation”, and that, secondly, there are identifiable intervarietal differences between British English and New Englishes as well as between individual New Englishes. In general, there is a correlation between the evolutionary stage of a New English variety and its collostructional nativisation: The more advanced a New English variety is in the developmental cycle, the more dissimilar its collostructional preferences are to British English.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

By Nigerian video film, we mean video films produced in, and/or about Nigeria in English as opposed to those produced in Nigerian indigenous languages which are variously known as Igbo video films, Yoruba video films, or Edo video films, among others. The data for this study come from a random selection from video films produced in Nigeria between 2003 and 2006. In all the films studied, it is observed that Igbo English is essentially the medium of communication. Igbo English is one of the three major ethnic varieties of Nigerian English and is characterized by the fact that, while the vocabulary is mostly English, the sentence pattern is essentially Igbo. The choice of Igbo English as the medium for the films seems to be part of the efforts by the producers to retain, as much as possible, the “Nigerianness” of the films, which inevitably have to be produced in English to accommodate the international audience. This study observes that Igbo English, as used in the films studied, manifests itself in four forms: Igbo English proper, composed of English vocabulary in Igbo sentence structure; Engligbo, a form of code-mixing that is almost a fifty-fifty blend of English and Igbo; translation, in which Igbo idiomatic and other rhetorical expressions are transferred literally into English; and errors induced by the influence of the mother tongue (Igbo) on English.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The real time comparison reveals that speakers who in the mid-1990s were in their teens to mid-20s have not only maintained, but considerably increased use of be like over time; women aged 27–40 have also maintained use of be like over time. Such findings provide evidence of generational change, as well as of “lifespan change” (Sankoff 2005).

A range of varieties are performed on the show by a handful of actors. We analyzed several linguistic variables in the speech of three of the main characters — the 14-year-old twins Vale and Valea, and their father Pepelo. Pepelo produces high levels of the vernacular features of DH-stopping and TH-fronting, consistent with his biography as a second-language speaker whose pronunciation is influenced by his native language, Samoan. His sons, as second-generation speakers, have these features too but at lower frequencies. The twins also differ from each other, with the streetwise Valea, who is more aligned with Pasifika youth culture, producing higher levels of the variables than the studious Vale. Pepelo produces unaspirated initial /p/s, again a Pasifika language feature, while his sons do not. Linking-/r/, however, appears to index a youth identity but not adult immigrant status.

Previous studies of InTs have clearly described InT uses in one language variety (e.g. Berland 1997, on London teenage talk; Stubbe and Holmes 1995, on NZ English; on sociolinguistic features e.g. Stubbe and Holmes 1995 and on single markers e.g. Avis 1972; Love 1973; Gibson 1977; Meyerhoff 1992 and 1994; Gold 2005, 2008 on eh). However, the class of InTs has not yet been fully described, and the variety of approaches taken (corpus- and survey-based) does not easily allow for cross-varietal or cross-linguistic comparison. This study investigates InTs in three varieties of English from a corpus-based approach. It lists the InTs available in New Zealand, British and Indian English through their occurrences in their respective International Corpus of English (ICE) corpora, and compares usages of four tags across the varieties. The description offers a clearer overview of the InT class for descriptive grammars, as well as more explicit definitions and usage guides for e.g. EFL/ESL pedagogy. An unambiguous description of several InTs and their meanings will also allow more thorough comparison in studies of other English varieties.

The overall effect is that East African English leans more towards the formal side (especially Dimensions 3, 5 and 6). There is a strong emphasis on the involvement of the addressee, more formal features for the encoding of information, and delineation of reference by textual rather than contextual means, even when the information is not very abstract.

The formants of the vowels of the read speech of five male and five female speakers of Malaysian English (MalE) are compared to an equivalent sample of speakers of Singapore English (SgE) in order to compare the vowel qualities between the two varieties.

Moreover, English has variants which repeat the operator either before or after the dislocated noun phrase (NP) or pronominal particle, e.g. She’s got a very good degree has Julie, which makes it unlike most of the languages with comparable RD forms. These variants are either ignored completely in RD literature or considered on their own. The present analysis aims, therefore, to provide a holistic view of RD strategies. Starting with a classification of the various RD strategies used in the North of England, where this variant is most often reported to be found, this paper will present a quantitative analysis of RD in a corpus of York speech. The analysis will demonstrate that, while RD forms are used by York speakers (young and old, male and female), with respect to overall frequency RD is in fact far more rare than reports make it out to be, and that its social distribution is rather unexpected in some respects.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Using quantitative sociolinguistic methods, factors such as level of English, length of residence, age, gender, motivation and attitude are considered in accounting for the variation in acquisition. Findings suggest that in addition to level of English and length of residence effects there is a fairly robust gender difference, with women tending to use glottal variants more frequently than men.

A method borrowed from biology will be applied to a set of lexical and structural features found in the sample presented in Hancock (1987) in order to assess the degrees of affinity between these languages and their evolutionary histories. We will argue that the phylogenetic networks approach proposed here is the most suitable for the classification of creole languages. At the same time, we will show that this tool can also be used to assess the degree of radicalness of a creole, another issue which has been at the heart of creole studies.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The present paper closes this gap by presenting an acoustic phonetic analysis of acrolectal Kenyan English. The data presented here consist of nine male speakers of acrolectal Kenyan English reading the “The North Wind and the Sun”-passage and were analysed using PRAAT (Boersma 2001; Boersma and Weenink 2008). As I will show, a careful visual and statistical analysis of the data unearthes several features of the Kenyan English vowel system that so far have gone unnoticed (e.g. a trend towards a seven vowel system with two front and two back mid vowels). Furthermore I will argue that some of these features can be traced back to the local L1 feature pool.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Many migrants came with their families. We examined variation in the English spoken by adolescent Polish migrants in Edinburgh and London. We asked: to what extent are teenage Polish migrants acquiring the patterns of variation typical of their local peer group? We compare the results for the well-known variable (ing) in the speech of both Polish migrants and their same age British peers. Our results indicate that the Polish teenagers seem to be sensitive to the overall rates of the non-standard variant in the city they have moved to. Moreover, Polish teenagers also replicate some of the linguistic and social constraints found in the speech of the locally-born teens. In some cases, they partially replicate the constraint patterns found in the locally-born teenagers, and in other cases they introduce novel constraints unattested in the speech of their locally-born peers. The results of our study raise several questions regarding local shared constraints and universal learning tools, potential supra-local constraints and the status of (ing) as a sociolinguistic variable for learners of English. We discuss these in the final section of this paper.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Blinglish in Korean hip hop can be understood as a prime example of “English from below” (Preisler 1999) to informally express subcultural identity and style. The findings of the study suggest that AAVE features appear at different linguistic levels including lexis, phonology, and morpho-syntax in Korean hip hop Blinglish but do not demonstrate the same degree of AAVE penetration, with a frequency-related hierarchy emerging among these linguistic components. The area of Korean hip hop Blinglish with the heaviest crossing influence from AAVE is found to be lexis followed by phonology. The presence of AAVE syntactic features is somewhat restricted in type and occurrence, indicating that the verbal markers in AAVE are considerably varied and intricate, and syntactic elements are not as easily crossed by non-AAVE speakers as lexical items.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

First, we analyze a corpus of blog and email writing from Jamaica and its diaspora — two settings in which both Jamaican Creole (JC) and a local standard of English are in use. Here, spelling is studied quantitatively as an expression of community-level attitudes toward JC in different settings. In a second step we draw on findings from a survey on attitudes toward language varieties and spelling variation among writers of Creole and English, contextualizing the quantitative analysis. Our findings indicate that diasporic writers make use of nonstandard spellings in a way that marks those lexical items as non-English (thus: as Creole) that are part of the historically shared lexicon of JC and English but whose meanings and functions have come to differ in the two varieties. By contrast, writers living in Jamaica prefer using spelling choices to mark codeswitches between English and Creole, and thus to construct symbolic distance between the codes. A comparison between genders shows women to make a more systematic use of nonstandard spellings according to linguistic constraints than men do.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

In this paper, we discuss the historical background for demonstrative them, its current distribution in a corpus of modern Appalachian speech, and its relations to the other modern plural demonstratives, these and those.

Broadly, stylized IndE speech contributes to the characters’ performance of localness, an evaluation that reviewers’ commentary of the novel corroborate. However, by drawing on Ochs’ model of direct and indirect indexicality to analyze the contextualized interactions of three groups of characters — Malpani, Shiv Sena drunk men, and Shiv Sena officers — I suggest that the characters more specifically combine stylized IndE features in different ways to display distinct stances. When assessed together with 1) sociohistorical details, 2) interlocutors’ comments, and 3) narratorial interruptions, such stylized IndE speech indirectly indexes and shapes their nuanced social roles in the novel as different types of villains. Stylized IndE features are thus indeterminate resources, braided together with other semiotic resources, and enabling the characters to perform fluid, contextually situated meanings.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This reconceptualization is, in turn, usefully employed to solve Trudgill’s (2004) so-called “South African puzzle’’: in essence, the postulation of SAfE as a late 19th-century English explains why START-Backing has occurred in SAfE but not in the closely related Australasian varieties.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The study finds important quantitative differences in the distribution of mother and father, as well as differences in the grammatical behavior of these and other kinship variants. While these results provide some support for a parental kin prototype, they also suggest the benefits that survey data collected within a variationist framework offer such a prototype, both with respect to the counterexamples to broad generalizations that such datasets inevitably include as well as the variable patterns that often emerge from such data that might go unobserved using formal methods.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

A historical corpus of written SAfE is used to trace the path of modality from the 19th to the late 20th century as preserved in letters, newspapers and fictional writing. The findings are, firstly, that modals decline only in the second half of the 20th century, after remaining relatively stable throughout the 19th and first half of the 20th century, and, secondly, that semi-modals do not increase in usage to the same extent as observed for other varieties of English. These patterns are attributed to a number of forces: trade-off relations between different modals to move away from excessive politeness to more direct forms, and developments within particular registers that favoured or disfavoured the use of specific modals.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Conceived as a sequel and companion piece to a previous study on Scottish rhyming slang by this author (Lillo 2004b), this article examines the way rhyming slang has thrived in Scotland over the past few years, thereby providing interesting insights into its role in the articulation of Scottish identity and its spread and growth around the anglophone world.

In a mobile and globalising world such contacts are by no means restricted to diffusion of features in face-to-face interaction, across contiguous territories in space or up and down the sociolinguistic scale. In order to better represent and understand the complex relationships obtaining between varieties of standard and non-standard English in the contemporary “English language complex” (McArthur 2003: 56; Mesthrie and Bhatt 2008: 1–3), the present paper proposes a new theoretical model, based on language systems theory (de Swaan 2002, 2010). While the model is not designed to supersede existing alternatives, such as the Kachruvian (1982) Circles, it will nevertheless complement them in important ways, chiefly because it is better equipped to handle uses of English in domains beyond the post-colonial nation state. The “World System of Englishes” model was developed in the course of the author’s work on the use of pidgins and creoles in web forums serving the post-colonial West African and Caribbean diasporas. The way Nigerian Pidgin figures in the creation of a globalised digital ethnolinguistic repertoire will hence serve as an illustration of its usefulness.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

With this aim, we report some first findings from a fieldwork study on the island and in a later step compare these with selected Caribbean varieties — Bahamian English (BahE), Bajan, Jamaican English, and Vincentian Creole, as reported in the Electronic World Atlas of Varieties of English (Kortmann and Lunkenheimer 2011). We argue that morphosyntactic similarities and differences between the varieties are explained by the Bermudian community’s sociohistorical and sociolinguistic contexts, including settlement patterns, population demographics, and peopling, and that the emergence and origins of a stable localised variety of (A)BerE need to be approached with reference to the historical connections between Bermuda and the communities that provided donor varieties. We further argue in favor of a two-way transfer pattern: Caribbean Englishes are likely to have influenced the evolution of English on Bermuda, while BerE itself was an influential input variety in other locations (particularly the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands).",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

THRIVE is a clear case of an irregular verb becoming regular; in the other four lexemes (DIVE, PLEAD, DRAG and SNEAK), the irregular forms are actually a new development, as the corpus analysis can show. Present-day Americanisms can thus be the result of different historical processes that diverge from British English: differential speed in the same process, or change in a different direction. In both cases of change, it is a valid question to ask whether they might have been the result of prescriptive pressure. In order to investigate the question in how far prescriptive grammars may have influenced this trend towards more regular or towards newly irregular forms, my corpus-linguistic data is correlated with changing recommendations in historical grammar books of English, based on a quantitative investigation of my collection of 258 grammars. I propose that prescriptive influence both on the regularization of THRIVE and on the process of ‘irregularization’ of DIVE, PLEAD, DRAG and SNEAK is minimal, and that we are most likely dealing with genuine changes from below. These changes are then, with some time lag, reflected in the (not so) prescriptive grammars of the time.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The results suggest that the intelligibility of SgE and AmE does differ between informants from different regions.

While SgE elicits generally positive attitudes, what is interesting is that the judgments of respondents from South-East Asia and East Asia are often more negative than those of English speakers of Inner Circle varieties.

On the basis of 6 353 adverbials in total, this paper suggests (1) that there is a L1–L2 divide, (2) that the difference between “traditional” and “transplanted” L1 varieties is less pronounced, (3) that L2 varieties allow more variation, which indicates that in these varieties, the present perfect is partly used as a tense (sensu Quirk et al. 1985), and (4) that some temporal adverbials are less categorically attached to either present perfect or past tense than others.

The occurrence of other variants in the corpus is accounted for in terms of the influence of the respective substrate languages, cognitive constraints characteristic of language-contact situations, pragmatic contextual factors such as the scant use of adverbial support, and, especially, diffusion from the input language, which is an earlier variety of spoken, non-standard English.

However, with the notable exception of Winter’s (2002) study of quotative be like in the speech of Melbourne adolescents, the Australian English quotative system remains virtually uncharted. I address this gap in the literature by offering a quantitative sociolinguistic analysis of the quotative system of Perth English, investigating to what extent linguistic (grammatical person, content of quote and tense) and social (age and sex) variables are implicated in the use of be like. My results stem from 32.5 hours (325 096 words) of spontaneous narratives of personal experience recorded with 47 speakers in Perth in 2011 and evince an overwhelming increase in the use of be like particularly amongst the youngest speakers — as compared to Winter’s (2002) findings for Melbourne in the late 1990s. Multivariate analysis using Goldvarb X (Sankoff, Tagliamonte and Smith 2005) indicates that — although some constraints like the favouring effect of first person subjects behave similarly across the generations and are in line with other Englishes — Australian be like is subject to different constraints across generations of young speakers. Pre-adolescent and adolescent girls are active agents of language change by upping be like’s frequency and its use with the historical present in narratives. Young adults are steady users of be like in historical present contexts but the significant effect of sex has reversed: it is young male adults — rather than women — who favour be like in this cohort. The findings are in line with trends noted in the literature on English quotation elsewhere and point once again to the irrevocable link between system-internal forces and social factors as speakers move through life.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
10.1075/eww.34.1.04van,Rias van den Doel; Hugo Quené,The endonormative standards of European English: Emerging or elusive?,2013,"It has been asserted that a common European variety of English is currently emerging. This so-called “European English” is claimed to be the result of convergence among non-native English speakers, and to reflect a gradual abandonment of Inner Circle norms, which are deemed to be increasingly irrelevant to non-native speakers’ communicative needs. Evidence is so far lacking that Europeans judge each other’s proficiency in English by anything other than native-speaker standards — particularly as regards pronunciation. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to establish whether European non-native speakers of English demonstrated convergence when evaluating the pronunciation of fellow Europeans, and in this respect deviated significantly not only from Inner Circle English native speakers but also from non-European judges. To investigate this possibility, a large-scale Internet survey was carried out in which different groups of users of English (native and non-native, European and non-European, N = 373) evaluated the pronunciation features of five European accents of English, by means of global ratings and detailed responses. The observed convergence of native and non-native judges’ responses does not correspond with emerging endonormative pronunciation standards on the European continent. Hence these findings fail to support the claims about an emerging European English variety.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Three of these are investigated here: Welsh English (WelE), a high-contact L1/L2 shift variety, Indian English, an indigenised L2 variety, and the traditional dialects of England, representing vernacular L1 English and a potential historical superstrate. Despite cross-varietal similarities, the PF proves to be quite distinctive in the corpora in terms of its structural, functional, and lexical properties. The patterns of variation are considered in relation to the primary substrate languages, Welsh and Hindi, the English English superstrate, and general developments in the use of the PF in English. The results indicate that the contact-induced varieties are typologically similar to the substrates in divergent ways and that the superstrate is clearly influential in WelE. Propositions of “angloversality” therefore need to be considered in light of regional linguistic ecologies and the structural and functional characteristics of (vernacular) English itself.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Using cluster analysis and regression modeling, I analyze how grammatical contexts constrain syntactic choices in EFL and ESL and how speakers with different instructional backgrounds develop different variation patterns in their own English variety. The regression model reveals that the English variety factor accounts significantly for syntactic variation. In addition, the study identifies a prototypical prepositional dative construction in non-native English, which serves as a default construction for learners in more complex grammatical contexts. This study stresses the importance of reaching beyond structural linguistic differences by investigating processing (dis)similarities between EFL and ESL and shows the usefulness of a cognitive theoretical framework as a unified approach to cross-varietal variation.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

It focuses on socio-cultural and subsequent phonetic change in two prestigious secondary school environments in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Adopting a poststructuralist lens, it considers how female isiXhosa mother tongue speakers, who attend private and ex-model-C English schools, are undergoing changes in identity, which are mirrored in the acquisition of a new, prestigious variety of English. The research adopts a Labovian form of data collection, notably the use of sociolinguistic interviews, as well as sociophonetic analysis. The findings suggest that changes in identity construction are evident, both in terms of speech accommodation and cultural assimilation. Middle-class isiXhosa mother tongue speakers are now proficient in both English and isiXhosa, and both languages are used strategically to take up different identity positions. The findings also suggest that a new prestigious English variety is emerging, one that is deracialised, and is associated rather with social class.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

A previous study (Drummond 2013) showed that acquisition of the local variant depended on various social factors, yet this only took into account conversation data, leaving some word list data unexplored. Comparing the two data sets reveals a difference in degree of acquisition, with the word list data producing more of the local vowel. This is explained not as a case of dialect acquisition as such, but more as an effect of orthography triggering a connection to the L1 phonology, the particular nature of which mimics acquisition of the local variant.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Surprisingly, the de facto role of English in Namibia has to date not been systematically and comprehensively investigated within the framework of World Englishes. This is a gap the present paper seeks to address. To this end, part one of our study provides insights drawn from a questionnaire-based inquiry into language use in the different domains of private and public life, questions of linguistic and cultural identity, as well as attitudes towards the different languages spoken in Namibia. Part two tentatively identifies some linguistic features on various linguistic levels as potential candidates for structural nativisation. Taken together, the overall results suggest an ongoing change of the status of English spoken in Namibia from English as a foreign language (EFL) to English as a second language (ESL).",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Drawing on the framework of variationist sociolinguistics, this study presents a detailed quantitative analysis of variable case marking in CoNPs in the Quebec English Corpus (Poplack, Walker and Malcolmson 2006), a massive compendium of vernacular speech. Operationalizing a number of extralinguistic and linguistic factors that are claimed to condition variable case marking in CoNPs, multivariate analysis revealed that speaker age and education as well as the syntactic position of the CoNP are key predictors in determining the case of pronouns in these constructions. An important finding is that case marking in CoNPs is highly variable for speakers, suggesting that the Sisyphean efforts of the prescriptive enterprise to impose uniformity on this area of the grammar have been to little avail as far as spontaneous usage is concerned. Comparison of the results with variable case marking in CoNPs in other varieties of English, as well as with diachronic patterns of variability, also raises the possibility that the accusative is increasingly assuming the role of default case in coordinate constructions.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Gries; Joybrato Mukherjee,The dative alternation in South Asian English(es): Modelling predictors and predicting prototypes,2014,"The present paper focuses on the modelling of cross-varietal differences and similarities in South Asian English(es) and British English at the level of verb complementation. Specifically, we analyse the dative alternation with GIVE, i.e. the alternation between the double-object construction (John gave Mary a book) and the prepositional dative (John gave a book to Mary) as well as their passivised constructions with regard to the factors that potentially exert an influence on this alternation in seven varieties of English. The South Asian varieties under scrutiny are Bangladeshi English, Indian English, Maldivian English, Nepali English, Pakistani English and Sri Lankan English, while British English serves as the reference variety. The patterns of GIVE are annotated according to the following parameters including potential predictors of the dative alternation: syntactic pattern and semantic class of GIVE; syntactic complexity, animacy, discourse accessibility and pronominality of constituents (cf. Gries 2003b; Bresnan and Hay 2008). The choices of complementation patterns are then statistically modelled using conditional inference trees and a random-forest analysis.The results indicate that many of the predictors found to be relevant in British English are at play in the South Asian varieties, too. The syntactic pattern of GIVE is, in descending order, uniformly influenced by the predictors pronominality of recipient, length of recipient, semantic class of GIVE and length of patient. Interestingly, the predictor country is marginal in accounting for the dative alternation of GIVE across the varieties at hand. Based on this observation, we derive variety-independent protostructions, i.e. abstract combinations of (cross-varietally stable) features with high predictive power for a particular syntactic pattern, which we argue to be part of the lexicogrammatical “common core” (Quirk et al. 1985: 16) of English.The implications of the present paper are twofold. While the order of the predictors regarding their influence on the dative alternation is clearly compatible with earlier studies (cf. e.g. Green 1974; Ransom 1979; Hawkins 1994; Gries 2003b), the stability of the order across varieties of English calls for a) a more fine-grained gradation of linguistic forms and structures at the lexis-grammar interface as indicators of structural nativisation and b) a revision of earlier verb-complementational findings specific to individual or groups of varieties of South Asian English.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The paper suggests that the English speaking community in the UAE is at the stage of pre-koinéization, one in which there is an increase in transparency with regard to features which are overly complex for ESL speakers. The very small number of children in the immigrant community and the instability of the community are constraints on the process of pre-koinéization, but this paper nevertheless suggests that there are users of acrolectal English who strive for greater transparency, and it provides examples of three ways in which they are doing so. These are through the extension of verb complementation patterns, the extension of patterns of transitivity, and the extension of the pluralization of nouns, and these changes are well documented in postcolonial Englishes (Schneider 2007).

In most English varieties, (ing) has two possible realisations: [ɪŋ] and [ɪn]. However, in Manchester, a third possibility exists: [ɪŋg]. Social meanings differ between age groups on three scales: articulateness, poshness and reliability. When compared to the youths, those in the older age group consider [ɪŋ] to sound substantially more articulate than [ɪn], as well as posher and more reliable than [ɪŋg]. In contrast, those in the younger group consider [ɪŋg] more reliable and posher-sounding than the older speakers.

Importantly, the grammar of the contact variety is found to be shaped by the transfer of gradient grammatical rules from the substrate language, and by stratification along stylistic parameters.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Recurrent features of translated language include explicitation, normalisation or conventionalisation, simplification, and homogenisation. Similar features in non-native indigenised varieties of English include hyperclarity, anti-deletion, regularisation, simplification and register shifts. This article adopts a multidimensional approach to analyse a translation corpus and a parallel set of texts from ICE East Africa, with ICE Great Britain as control corpus. The aim is to determine whether translated and non-native indigenised varieties of English resemble each other due to shared constraints related to bilingual language production. The results demonstrate three shared sets of features between translated and non-native indigenised varieties of English: increased formality, explicitation of information through elaboration and specification, and features resulting from processing strain. The most important difference is that translated English uses more complex, compressed syntactic structures for elaboration while the non-native indigenised variety relies more on clausal structures.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The study adopts a multinomial regression approach, which takes into consideration the interaction of three potential predictors: syntactic function, text type, and variety. The results underline the need for text-type-sensitive studies and add to an understanding of syntactic contact phenomena in varieties of English.

In services outsourced to India, as in other postcolonial settings, the customer accent typically does not have a place in that agent’s repertoire.

In this map task experiment, 16 IT workers from Pune (half of whom regularly spoke to American colleagues on the telephone) gave directions to American followers. There was evidence of imitation of the bath vowel with an American addressee. However, imitation did not depend on exposure alone.

Harris’s (2013)
recent description of three core rhotic systems (R1, R2 and R3) demonstrates that this dichotomy is overly simplistic. The literature describes New Zealand English (NZE) as “non-rhotic”, with partial rhoticity in the lower South Island. This paper reports on data collected in two semi-rural towns in the North Island where young New Zealanders employ a “mixed” distribution of rhoticity. Alongside /r/ use which is traditionally associated with “non-rhotic” varieties (Harris’s R2 and R3), speakers also exhibit /r/ use which is associated with “rhotic” varieties (Harris’s R1). The findings suggest that dynamic rhoticity in NZE, which also persists historically in Englishes world-wide, can be represented more effectively by dispensing with the notions “rhotic” and “non-rhotic”, and by treating rhoticity as a continuum of /r/ use.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

While tense and aspect preferences of the passives were diachronically stable, the results of the situation-type analysis were of interest for two reasons. First, they showed clear differences in the way get- and be-passives are used which reflect the get-passive’s inchoative origins. And second, the diachronic analysis of situation-type preferences for get-passives provides a first indication that they may be further grammaticalizing as they begin to behave more like canonical be-passives in the most recent data.

Rates of preterite come vary markedly across different age cohorts and minority ethnic groups, foregrounding the importance of social factors as key determinants of variant use. By contrast, the internal conditioning of variant selection is not robust, as inferred from the paucity of significant linguistic effects. Similarities in variable patterning in elderly and adolescent Anglo speaker groups nevertheless suggest that shared structural affinities may be due to historical transmission. Conversely, comparison of Anglo and non-Anglo adolescents’ use of come/came variation reveals fewer correspondences in the grammar underlying variable use.

An analysis of comparable samples from the spoken component of the International Corpus of English (ICE) is carried out; in addition to the varieties mentioned above, data from ICE-GB are included for comparison. The analysis shows that certain features and structures predominate in specific varieties, and also illustrates constructions which are specific to the Asian varieties under investigation.

The study tracks changes in grammatical colloquialism from the early 20th century against the historical backdrop of the progressive decline in Britishness in Australia and the pervasive effects of “Americanisation”. The data are derived from a suite of parallel Brown-family corpora representing British, American, and Australian English of the 1930s, 1960s, 1990s and 2006. Multivariate techniques are used to delimit 26 “colloquial” and “anti-colloquial” grammatical features from a set of 83 potentially relevant features, and to examine changes in their frequencies between 1931 and 2006, in the three varieties, and across the three major genres of fiction, learned writing and press reportage.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

We then explore the constructions semantically and qualitatively. Overall, associations between the two constructions and Achievements and Accomplishments on the one hand, and semantic domains other than Activity or Existence on the other, do not unanimously influence writers’ constructional choices. Further, there may not be one single core meaning of the progressive, but rather a complex of meanings activated by the use of the progressive construction. Ultimately, we paint a multifaceted picture of the meanings of the progressive and show the benefit of combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to explore constructional semantics across Englishes.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

It presents first results from a larger questionnaire study on a number of pragmatic variables in Namibian English (NamE), a variety of English that only recently has aroused the interest of a number of researchers because of its unique history and complex variety status. The study employs methods successfully applied in variational pragmatics and describes the realization of responses to thanks in NamE in comparison to three L1-varieties of English. As the paper shows, NamE differs from these varieties in various ways. It argues that these differences, although possibly being more in degree than in kind, nevertheless index local Namibian solutions in the complex linguistic ecology of the speech community.

The overlap and non-overlap comparisons reveal (dis)similarities in the use of bundles across the four World Englishes (WEs). Our findings suggest that in terms of discourse building blocks, the more advanced a variety is according to Schneider’s (2007) Dynamic Model of New Englishes, the more lexical bundles it shares with the common core in conversation. Canadian English (CanE) shares the most common ground with British English (BrE). As a nascent variety, Hong Kong English (HKE) differs most from BrE, while Singapore English falls between CanE and HKE.

This study explores the implicit language attitudes of a sample of 84 young Coloured South Africans towards two historically White accents in the country: the Standard South African English accent and Afrikaans-accented English. In order to shed light on the role of language in the process of social categorization among the younger generations, I present a mixed-methodological approach that investigates the interrelation between the results of an Implicit Association Test (IAT) towards the two selected accents and the participants’ linguistic background, language exposure, and social distance levels. Within the target demographic, the data confirm the existence of an overall positive implicit attitude towards Standard South African English, although positive attitudes towards Afrikaans-accented English were not uncommon. Correlations between IAT effect and the variables “social distance levels with Whites” and “places of residence” provide potential explanations and valuable sociolinguistic information about the language dynamics in this diverse ethnic group.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The decline of central modal must and the increase in frequency of the semi-modals have
(got) to, need (to), and want to is one of the most conspicuous grammatical changes that
inner-circle varieties of English underwent in the second half of the 20th century. Such a replacement correlates with the
increasing grammaticalization of the semi-modals in terms of semantic and quantitative developments. The current paper explores
the differential grammaticalization of these items in four Asian varieties of English – those spoken in India, Hong Kong,
Singapore, and the Philippines – with the aim of building a grammaticalization index that will allow us to measure the extent to
which the replacement of modal must with the semi-modals is completed in each of the varieties as compared to
British English. After analyzing data from the private dialogue sections of the corresponding ICE corpora, Hong Kong English is
shown to be the variety in which the replacement is closest to British English, followed by the Philippines, Singapore and
India.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

L1 background is often described as the main factor accounting for variation in postcolonial ESL varieties. However, recent studies (e.g. Mesthrie 2009, 2017) suggest that variation patterns in ESL varieties can in some cases also be linked to identity factors rooted in local patterns of intergroup relations. This study examines the interrelation between L1 background and such identity factors in the phonetic patterns found in the English varieties spoken in Namibia. The data consist of a corpus of careful style elicited via sociolinguistic interviews from an ethnically stratified sample of L2 English speaking Namibian students with Afrikaans, Bantu languages (Oshiwambo and Otjiherero), and Khoekhoeghowab as L1s. Individual speakers tend to be related in their phonetic behaviors if they share the same L1. However, some features cannot be directly attributed to L1 background, so their distribution is best read against the background of Namibian inter-ethnic relations and ethnolinguistic vitality differentials.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The English words for daily meals constitute a complex lexical variable conditioned by social and linguistic
factors. Comparative sociolinguistic analysis of 884 speakers from more than a dozen locations in Ontario, Canada reveals a

Toronto and Loyalist settlements in southern Ontario use the highest rates of dinner while northerners with
European and Scots-Irish roots use supper. Dinner is taking over as the dominant form among younger speakers,

This article provides a comparative analysis of the suppletive allomorphy of two personal pronouns in the five
African English-lexifier Creoles (AECs) Krio (Sierra Leone), Pichi (Equatorial Guinea), Ghanaian Pidgin English, Nigerian Pidgin,

non-clitic) is conditioned by a tonal obligatory contour principle (ocp), a vowel height ocp, animacy, and focus in different
constellations across the five AECs. In addition, an epenthetic /r/ is recruited in four of the AECs to ensure that the ocp is not
breached. The analyses suggest that pronominal suppletion in the AECs has been fashioned by processes of change and
differentiation typical of geographically extensive language families, such as migration from linguistic homelands, acquisition by non-founder populations, interlectal cross-diffusion, as well as contact and convergence with adstrate,

Informational versus Personal Focus; (ii) Addressee Focus; (iii) Thematic Variation; and (iv) Narrative Style. The aim is to

results show that Pakistani and U.S. columns differ significantly from each other, while blogs have less significant differences.
Further investigation into sub-categories of blogs reveals significant differences among technology blogs, while news blogs and
individual blogs differ less significantly. An examination of possible causes shows that geographical origin, the situational
characteristics of the register, and the internet as a medium play a role in variation. It is further suggested that internet

Usage-based research in linguistics has to a large extent relied on corpus data. However, a feature’s “failure to
appear in even a very large corpus (such as the Web) is not evidence for ungrammaticality, nor is appearance evidence for
grammaticality” (Schütze and Sprouse 2013: 29). It is therefore advisable to complement
corpus-based analyses with experimental data, so as to (ideally) obtain converging evidence. This paper reviews reasons for
combining corpus linguistic with psycholinguistic experimental methods, and demonstrates how research on varieties of English can
profit from experimentation. For a study of conversion in Asian Englishes, the maze task (Forster, Guerrera, and Elliot 2009; Forster 2010) was implemented with a
web-based, open-source software. The results of the experiment dovetail with a previous analysis of the Corpus of Global
Web-based English (Davies 2013). These results should encourage
researchers not to base findings exclusively on corpus evidence, but corroborate them by means of experimental data.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

resultant information about the Dublin English quotative system as a baseline to assess the extent to which this system has been
acquired by Polish-born L2 speakers of English differentiated in terms of target language proficiency. Comparison of the L2

This study examined the English accents of English-Malay bilinguals in Singapore to ascertain whether language
dominance was a determinant of accent variation in Singapore English, with a hypothesis that a Malay-dominant bilingual would have
more ethnic-specific features than an English-dominant one. Ten English-Malay bilinguals – five English-dominant and five
Malay-dominant – who differed greatly in their language dominance took part in this study. In an ethnic discriminability task that
involved 60 naïve raters, Malay-dominant bilinguals were significantly more often correctly identified as ethnically Malay and
were rated as having a significantly more perceivable Malay-accented English accent, while those who were English-dominant had an
English accent that lacked ethnic-specific features so much so that naïve raters, including raters who were English-Malay
bilinguals, were less able to identify the speakers as ethnically Malay. The results of this study indicate that early sequential
bilinguals or simultaneous bilinguals of the same two languages need not have similar accents. The findings also suggest that
language dominance is a determinant of accent variation in Singapore English, at least for the English-Malay bilinguals.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

To find empirical evidence for Schneider’s (2007) periodisation for the
emergence of Hong Kong English, Evans (2014, 2015) scrutinised various historical documents, such as newspapers, council proceedings and jury lists. Taking the
increasing use of the terms Hongkonger and Hongkong people during the 1980s as evidence for the
emergence of a new Hong Kong identity, he argued that the Chinese population considered themselves part of the community. This
paper systematises Evans’ (2014) approach by analysing terms denoting ingroup and
outgroup members in English news discourse in Hong Kong from 1903 to 1999. By tracing changes in frequency, reference and
discourse topics associated with the terms, periods of identity reconstructions are uncovered and Schneider’s and Evans’
periodisations reassessed. The study thus contributes to our understanding of the social dynamics in Hong Kong’s history, which

Quotative be like has been described as “one of the most striking developments [in English]”

upsurge of be like, the potential impact of discourse type on the grammar of quotation has rarely been assessed.
Yet, discourse type has proved a relevant factor in linguistic variation (see Travis

Lindstrom 2016). Drawing on vernacular spoken data from our multigenerational corpus of Australian English, we include
discourse type as a predictor in our recursive partitioning and logistic regression models. Our results show that similar
linguistic constraints operate on be like across discourse types. However, significant differences emerge
regarding its social conditioning in narrative as opposed to non-narrative discourse, pointing to a strong association between
be like and female storytelling.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

World Englishes are the product of contact between English and other languages in multilingual habitats through
the nativization phase. Yet the actual contexts of code-switching that contribute to the emerging regional variety have scarcely
been described. This research focuses on code-switching among bilingual Filipino students, to illuminate this dynamic phase in
varietal evolution. Using data from an online academic forum, it analyses the code-switching patterns within and between turns in
the discussion, to see how they facilitate or inhibit the mobilization of Tagalog elements into code-mixed English. The data show
intense levels of code-switching especially within individual turns. At the change of turns, the sequentiality principle is often
set aside, and code-switching often involves Tagalog discourse markers and other function words. These include some elements noted
two decades earlier (Bautista 1998) as potential features of evolving Philippine
English, which have never been codified. The new data provide empirical evidence of how non-English elements are progressively
taken up into World Englishes, in interactive use of English among bi-/multilingual speakers.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Descriptions of Australian Aboriginal English list the neutralisation of the Standard English contrast between so-called voiced and voiceless stops as one characteristic feature.

The results show that average values for Voice Onset Time, the main correlate of the “stop voicing contrast” in English, and Closure Duration collected from Aboriginal speakers of English do not significantly differ from that of speakers of Standard Australian English, irrespective of language background. This result proves that the stop contrast is not neutralised by these Aboriginal speakers of English. However, it can be shown that phonetic voicing manifesting itself in Voice Termination Time is a prevalent and characteristic feature of Aboriginal English on Croker Island. This feature aligns Aboriginal English on Croker Island with local Aboriginal languages and differentiates it from Standard Australian English.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Namibia in the 19th century and are known for their strong sense of a separate local and ethnic identity. Triangulating the

frequency of the construction as well as the productivity of the verbal, nominal, and prepositional slots of the construction
correlate positively with a variety’s phase in the Dynamic Model. Moreover, it turns out that the less entrenched a variety is

shows that priming significantly facilitates SUF like use, that SUF like has increased between
an earlier (1990–1994) and a later phase (2002–2005) of data collection and that, between 2002 and 2005, SUF like
use correlates negatively with audience size but not so in data collected between 1990 and 1994. The relative absence of
significant social stratification of SUF like use suggests that SUF like continues to be a

linguistic competence in English. We therefore propose two continua of variation: MaltE as an L2 continuum and as a situational
one. Within this framework, we identify two groups defined as Mainly Maltese Speakers (MMS) and Mainly English Speakers (MES). We
suggest that MaltE can be interpreted both as an L2, and as a variety used according to speech events, domain, participants,
in-groupness etc. To investigate this we carried out a perceptual experiment involving two groups of university students,
specialising in Maltese and English respectively. We discuss the results based on ratings and evaluations of authentic MaltE

This study explores the role of linguistic structure in speakers’ perceptions of vernacular English, i.e. speech used in informal interactions. In so doing, it tests the assumptions of the Interface Principle (Labov 1993) and its major claim that semantic and discourse-pragmatic features will elicit a greater degree of social awareness than morphosyntactic variants (Levon and Buchstaller 2015). Relying on data obtained from 372 respondents, we explore the social perceptions of two discourse-pragmatic and two morphosyntactic variables. We show that the morphosyntactic features investigated here are generally available to the sociolinguistic monitor of L1 speakers as well as highly advanced learners of English as a Foreign Language. However, these morphosyntactic features are less salient than the semantic/discourse pragmatic variants, and their social indexation is, for this reason, more pliable. We argue for the weaker version of the Interface Principle and propose that the differences in the recognisability of vernacular features is gradient. We additionally propose that juxtaposing different types of speaker data is instrumental in discerning those differences.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Naijá (also known as Nigerian Pidgin) is an extended pidgin with millions of speakers in Nigeria, and it is also a creole since some communities use it as a first language (Faraclas 2013; Mazzoli 2017). It is a common lingua franca in former English colonies in West Africa and has potential for transnational use. Notwithstanding its importance at multiple levels, Naijá is not mentioned in language-related policies in Nigeria, and its use in education is limited and stigmatized. This is due to aggressive ideologies that identify Naijá as an inferior language, especially with respect to English in Nigeria. In this paper, based on fieldwork data collected in southern Nigeria, I outline positive and negative ideologies related to Naijá, and argue that innovative ideologies have emerged among Naijá native speakers, which constitute a base for elaborating endoglossic policies and introducing Naijá into the classroom.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

The present study investigates rhotics in Standard Scottish English (SSE). Drawing on an auditory analysis of formal
speeches given in the Scottish parliament by 49 speakers (members of parliament and the general public), it examines whether an underlying
rhotic standard exists for SSE speakers from all over Scotland, whether and where rhotics are realized as trills/taps or approximants, and
what factors influence variation in the realization and distribution of rhotics. The results show that SSE is variably rhotic, with 54% of
all non-linking coda /r/ realized, and that trills/taps are more frequent in intervocalic (onset and linking coda) position. The findings
contradict the idea of SSE being generally rhotic but rather confirm previous reports of increasing occurrence of non-rhoticity, not just by
specific speaker groups, but also in a formal context. They further show that variation in rhotics in SSE foremost tends to be affected by
language-internal than language-external factors.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This article investigates the speech of adolescents who have moved directly from Poland to Glasgow, using data
from a range of social contexts and comparing their speech to that of their locally-born peer-group. Focusing on the acquisition
of word-medial glottal replacement, I find that the Polish participants have replicated one of the constraints shown by their
locally-born peers (number of syllables), have come close to replicating another (following segment), and have three which are not
significant for the Glaswegians: lexical frequency, preceding segment and speech context. The emergence of the speech context
constraint for the Polish group (and not for the Glaswegians) is a novel finding, and sheds light on how learners come to
understand and negotiate style in the L2. I suggest that as they are going through the acquisition process, the Polish group use
speech context as an interpretive framework around which they structure their stylistic variation.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Language attitude research is crucial for a deeper understanding of New Englishes. However, the most common
attitude research methods often cause problems when applied to New Englishes contexts. We discuss the benefits and challenges of
different methods used in two attitude studies on the perception of linguistic variation in Jamaica and Trinidad. Five major
issues arise out of the discussion: the careful consideration of abstract labels, the need for contextualized research and
authentic source material, the limited view of written data collection with closed questions, the crucial role of the researcher,
and the opportunities of mixed-methods research. These conclusions are particularly relevant for research on New Englishes but

This paper focuses on a phenomenon known as pre-aspiration, defined as a period of glottal friction found in the
sequences of sonorants and phonetically voiceless obstruents, as in hit [hɪht], hat
[hæht], hiss [hɪhs], and cash [kæhʃ]. Pre-aspiration has
been reported in North American English (Clayards and Knowles 2015); however, there are
no systematic studies of pre-aspiration in this part of the English-speaking world. Our study therefore considers the following
main questions. 1. Is pre-aspiration present in American English and how frequent is it? 2. Does it vary by region? We also map
variation related to speaking task, sex, and a range of language-internal factors. Our analyses of data from the Nationwide Speech
Project Corpus (Clopper and Pisoni 2006) confirm that pre-aspiration is a feature of
American English, with rates of application reaching between 0–20 percent, depending on the region and the task. Furthermore, the
more formal the task, the higher the rate of pre-aspiration application.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper discusses the obsolescence of h-dropping as a local feature in Maryport, West Cumbria. Using sociolinguistic interview data, a quantitative approach and mixed-effects modelling is used to explain the linguistic changes in the community. Sociolinguistic accounts of h-dropping always state that the feature is and has been stigmatised in England since the 18th century. However, the oldest speakers in the sample do not change their level of h-dropping in more formal speech styles, which indicates that the standard language ideology of “proper” English might not be pervasive for them. However, for speakers born after 1960 the use of h-dropping is decreasing in apparent time. From the 1960s onwards, Maryport has seen social change as the strong neighbourhood ties broke up and from the 1980s experienced strong job losses. I argue that these social changes are correlated with the decline and eventual obsolescence of h-dropping in the community.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper explores functions of pseudonyms in written threatening communication from a cognitive sociolinguistic
perspective. It addresses the semantic domains present in pseudonyms in a corpus of 19th-century Irish English threatening notices
and their cognitive functions in the construction of both cultural-contextualised threat and the threatener’s identity. We
identify eight semantic domains that are accessed recurrently in order to create threat. Contributing to the notion of threat
involves menacing war, violence, darkness and perdition directly, while also constructing a certain persona for the threatener
that highlights their motivation, moral superiority, historical, local and circumstantial expertise, and their physical and mental
aptitude. We argue that pseudonyms contribute to the deontic force of the threat by accessing cultural categories and schemas as
well as conceptual metaphors and metonymies. Finally, we suggest that pseudonyms function as post-positioned semantic frame
setters, providing a cognitive lens through which the entire threatening notice must be interpreted.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

While different automated procedures for vowel formant prediction have recently been proposed, it is unclear how reliably
these methods perform in the phonetic study of vowels in New Englishes and how such approaches could be applied to specific varieties. This
paper compares different automatic methods for vowel formant prediction in New Englishes, using manual measurements of Trinidadian English
as a baseline. The results show that all methods perform significantly better than default formant parameters often used in speech analysis
packages, and that a Bayesian formant tracker calibrated with American (US-FAVE) and Trinidadian English (TRINI-FAVE) generally provides
better results than an automatic procedure that optimizes formant ceilings on a vowel- and speaker-specific level. TRINI-FAVE measures
vowels characteristic of Trinidadian English most accurately. Phonetic studies of vowels in New Englishes can benefit from these

Negative attitudes of non-Singaporeans towards Singapore Colloquial English (SCE) are often used to support the “Speak Good

In this study, we examine variation in English strong verb preterite/participle morphology in four frequent verbs:
came/come, saw/seen,
gave/give and did/done, using data from more than a dozen
Ontario communities, socially stratified by age, sex, occupation and education, representing a continuum of urban/rural locations
and spanning more than 100 years in apparent-time. Comparative sociolinguistic methods and statistical modelling permit testing of
social, geographic and linguistic factors on the variation. Despite strong social constraints, linguistic constraints are also
significant. We argue that standardization and increasing literacy have nearly eradicated the vernacular preterite forms, but they
are not moribund yet. Moreover, at least one form is stable, preterite seen. The non-standard variants endure as
sociolinguistic markers, perhaps due to locally situated prestige, particularly in non-urban communities.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

An understanding of linguistic heterogeneity in older speakers is crucial for the study of language variation and change. To date, intra-speaker malleability in older populations remains under-researched, in varieties of English and more generally. This paper contributes panel data to the question of how aging individuals engage with ongoing changes in the realisation of (t) in the Tyneside region in the North-East of England. We examine the variable ways in which six speakers recorded in their 20s/30s and re-interviewed in their 60s/70s adapt to community-wide change. The finding that some speakers exhibit malleability in their variable realisation of (t) substantiates a life-course perspective over a strict maturational explanation. More specifically, our analysis explores the contribution of long-term (in)stability to lifespan-specific identity construction in the Tyneside area. Our findings support calls for the incorporation of sophisticated statistical methods in combination with social constructivist approaches into panel research on older age populations.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

This paper provides a quantitative variationist analysis of the distribution of get- versus
be-passives in spoken Tyneside English. Taking data from the Diachronic Electronic Corpus of Tyneside
English (1960s to 2010), the paper uses mixed-effects modelling to examine a wide range of possible constraints on
the distribution of get versus be, some of which have been discussed at length in the literature
on the get-passive (e.g. subject animacy, adversative semantics) and some of which have received less attention
(e.g. grammatical person, tense, aspectuality). It demonstrates that the use of the get-passive is determined by
a complex combination of semantic and syntactic factors (subject animacy, telicity, non-neutral semantics, tense and grammatical
person). Moreover, it argues that, despite the dramatic rise in frequency of get-passives over time (with younger
speakers using them even more frequently than be-passives), most of the constraints remain in place and the
variant is pragmatically marked. This stands in sharp contrast to the findings of recent investigations into the
grammaticalization of get-passives in standard British and American English, which found that increased frequency
in those varieties was also accompanied by semantic bleaching and generalization.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Our finding that this cohort of English learners performs better at production of nuclear tones than in the corresponding

Do accent biases observed half a century ago (Giles 1970) and 15 years ago (Coupland and Bishop 2007) still hold in Britain today? We provide an updated picture of national attitudes to accent labels by replicating and extending previous studies. Mean ratings and relative rankings of 38 accents for prestige and pleasantness by a large representative sample of the British population (N = 821) attest to a remarkably stable, long-standing hierarchy of accent status. We find little evidence of demotion of conservative prestige varieties or reranking of accents, although we do observe a slight improvement in lower rankings. We focus in detail on age and life stage, finding that most of the age patterns observed in earlier studies were in fact instances of age-grading (lifespan effects), not real-time change in attitude. The midlife phase of life corresponds to conservative shifts in the perception of global, migrant-heritage, and stigmatised varieties. Our findings add change in speech evaluation to the growing body of research on lifespan change in speech production. Finally, although effects of ethnicity, social class, regional self- and other-bias, and age remain firmly in place, earlier gender differences in respondent behaviour have more or less disappeared.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

From a sample of 75 fourth-year university students it collected self-reports of which words they used from 93 pairs of
American-vs-British English counterparts. These self-reports were then compared with, among others, the frequencies of the same
words in two corpora of Kenyan English which were compiled two decades apart. The study found that the respondents’ self-reports

with regard to the preference for frequent realisations and productivity, postcolonial varieties turn out to be very similar to
British English. These results come as a surprise against the background of similar studies of the
way-construction, where all of these effects have been documented convincingly. It is argued that the properties
of into-causatives themselves (e.g. their idiomatic and semantic simplicity) might contribute to their more

The study employs expanded versions of ICE administrative subcorpora for the analysis. Features analyzed include lexis, orthography, as well as different morphosyntactic constructions such as be-passives and modals of obligation and necessity.

Our findings do not contradict the small subset of previous research which explored regional and/or social variation in voice quality in British English insofar as regionality may play a small role in a speaker’s voice quality profile. However, factors such as social standing and identity could perhaps be even more relevant. Even when considering homogeneous groups of speakers, it is not the case that there is a cohesive voice quality profile that can be attached to every speaker within the group.

Results of the production task show that Spanish-dominant participants make robust use of calque expressions; second-generation participants use them less. Results of mixed linear effects regression analysis show that Miamians perceive of local expressions more favorably than national participants, though like national raters rank non-calque expressions more highly than calques. The approval of the Miami raters to the local expressions was driven primarily by six test items: (e.g. get down from the car).",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE

Previous language attitude research in Hong Kong compared Hong Kong English (HKE) to exonormative standard

but the difference was most evident on status dimensions. Thus, speakers of HKE are seen as likeable, competent and proficient,
which suggests that Hong Kong may have entered into the nativisation stage of Kachru’s

Spoken in a multilingual environment characterised by continuous contacts with other languages, Singapore English

including the substratist and the grammaticalisation approaches. The present paper explores both these approaches with the aim of
examining the role that they may have in the development of the (semi-)modal verbs of necessity in SgE. Using some corpus analysis
conducted on informal data, it will be shown why the substratist approach does not seem sufficient to explain the relatively
frequent non-epistemic uses of must in SgE. It will be discussed how SgE must could be instead
replicating older dynamic uses, typical of Middle English times (1100–1500 CE), according to a process known as

10.1075/eww.21071.ste,Gerald Stell,Afrikaans English as a Southern Hemisphere English: Perspectives from a Namibian bilingual dataset,2023,"Abstract
Afrikaans English is seen as connected to White South African English (WSAfE), a Southern Hemisphere English. What
makes Afrikaans-speakers’ English varieties distinctly WSAfE or distinctly Afrikaans in a context that has seen much convergence
between English and Afrikaans? To answer this question, this study looks at experimental English and Afrikaans phonetic data
simultaneously elicited from an informant sample representing three Afrikaans-speaking populations in Namibia, a former dependency
of South Africa: the Afrikaners, Basters, and Coloureds. By comparing the informants’ English and Afrikaans vowels, the study
establishes that their English varieties display unmistakable WSAfE features, especially found among the Whites, while some of
their English vowels co-vary with their nearest Afrikaans equivalents. While generally showcasing the methodological benefits of
bilingual data elicitation, the study concludes that postcolonial L2 English varieties are likely to mirror change-in-progress
occurring in their historical L1 models, even where access to these models becomes disrupted.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
10.1075/eww.21070.mul,Julia Müller; Christian Mair,Nigerian English as a Lingua Franca: Intelligibility and attitudes in German-speaking contexts,2023,"Abstract
This paper investigates the use of Nigerian English in lingua-franca interaction in Germany, focussing on the perspective of the German listener. Fifty-eight German-speaking respondents were asked to transcribe short extracts from English interviews recorded with Nigerian immigrants and sojourners resident in Germany. In addition to testing comprehension, respondents were requested to rate samples along parameters designed to measure speaker likability and competence. The study’s two major findings are that, in spite of the absence of contextual clues, respondents perform better than expected in the comprehension task, but that the single greatest obstacle to comprehension is the presence of German-language material in the stimulus. As realistic English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) interaction in Germany necessarily involves a level of English-German mixing, the experiment thus points to a major practical problem in ELF interaction. The study also yields provisional findings on gender (with male voices being understood better than female ones) and interactions between assumptions about speakers and transcription performance that should be revisited in future research.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
10.1075/eww.21065.ola,Foluke Olayinka Unuabonah; Folajimi Oyebola,“He’s a lawyer you know and all of that”: General extenders in Nigerian English,2023,"Abstract
This study examines the use of general extenders in Nigerian English, from a variational corpus-pragmatic framework, with British English as a reference variety. The data are extracted from the Nigerian and British components of the International Corpus of English. The results reveal that Nigerian English has patterns of use of general extenders that differ systematically from British English. Overall, Nigerian English users employ general extenders less frequently than British English users, as a result of a low preference for disjunctive extenders; there are no significant differences in the frequency of adjunctive and other general extenders between Nigerian and British English users. The study also identifies variants of general extenders unique to Nigerian English such as and all that one, and and other things (like that). In all, the results indicate that register and regional differences play important roles in determining general extender usage among English users.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
10.1075/eww.21016.li,Lijun Li; Eliane Lorenz; Peter Siemund,The ages of pragmatic particles in Colloquial Singapore English: A corpus study based on oral history interviews,2023,"Abstract
The study aims to work towards a diachronic reconstruction of pragmatic particles in Colloquial Singapore English (CSE, also known as “Singlish”) by exploiting an unused historical data source: The Oral History Interviews held by the National Archives of Singapore (OHI-NAS). We investigate the distribution of five pragmatic particles (ah, lah, leh, lor, and meh) in 101 interviews conducted between 1979 and 2009 in speakers born between 1899 and 1983. Lim (2007) reconstructs the origin of these particles in different substrate languages, with the first two particles (ah and lah) being traceable to earlier Bazaar Malay and/or Hokkien, while the latter three (leh, lor, and meh) are of later Cantonese origin. The results of the present study show that ah and lah are the most frequent particles attested earliest. Their frequency of use increases over time, being additionally contingent on the gender and age of the speakers, their educational level, and their ethnic background. The particles ah and lah are mostly used in assertive contexts.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
10.1075/eww.21017.rod,Yliana V. Rodríguez; Adolfo Elizaincín; Paz González,The Spanish component of Falkland Islands English,2023,"Abstract
English is the most used language in the Falkland Islands; however, Spanish was also spoken in the 19th century, when beef livestock farming was one of the economic engines of the Islands. Such businesses used to be managed by gauchos from
South America, and their presence is still evident in the lexicon of Falkland Islands English. This article presents a novel
methodological approach to the elaboration of loanwords corpora. Loanwords are later analysed in terms of their occurrence,
frequency, appearance in dictionaries and the semantic fields they have penetrated. We have attempted to account for the volume of
words that Spanish speakers lent to the Islands’ English. We observed that Spanish loanwords are mainly – though not exclusively –
related to horse tack and horse types: it is clear from our data that most words are tightly connected to gauchos’ vernacular and
not exclusively with their equestrian duties.",ENGLISH WORLD-WIDE
