10.1353/lan.0.a905553,Marisa Brook; Emily Blamire,Language play is language variation: Quantitative evidence and what it implies about language change,2023,"This article argues that language play is intimately related to linguistic variation and change.
Using two corpora of online present-day English, we investigate playful conversion of adjectives
into abstract nouns (e.g. made of awesome∅), uncovering consistent rule-governed patterning in
the grammatical constraints in spite of this option stemming from deliberate subversion of standard
overt suffixation. Building on Haspelmath’s (1999) notion of ‘extravagance’ as one of the keys to
language change, we account for the systematic patterning of deliberate linguistic subversion by
appealing to tension between the need to stand out and the need to remain intelligible. While we do
not claim that language play is the only cause of linguistic change, our findings position language
play as a constant source of new linguistic variants in very large numbers, a small proportion of
which endure as changes. Our conclusion is that language play goes a long way toward accounting
for linguistic innovations—with respect to where they come from and why languages change at all.",LANGUAGE

Nakh-Daghestanian language Chirag Dargwa, which lies at the intersection between two phenomena
known from previous research: overt controlled subjects and partial control. Despite being less
widespread crosslinguistically, these two phenomena do occur in various unrelated languages and
are known to not quite fit in with existing theories of OC. Combined in a single construction, they
yield a new empirical option in the typology of OC and provide evidence in favor of a pro analysis
of controlled subjects",LANGUAGE
