10.32473/sal.v22i3.107420,Christopher Ehret,The consonant inventory of Proto-Eastern Cushitic,1991,"Hans-Jiirgen Sasse established a solid initial reconstruction of the proto-Eastern Cushitic (PEC) consonants. This initial system had about 20 to 23 consonants. Further work by Linda Arvanites indicated the existence of several additional consonants. The current work rounds out the PEC consonant system and shows it to consist of 30 consonants in all. These for a moderately well-balanced system of voiced stops, voiced implosives in four different positions of articulation, and voiceless stops and ejective stops in three different positions of articuation. PEC also had five non-laryngeal fricatives, the full array of laryngeals that one has come to expect from Afroasiatic languages, l, r, w, y, and most interestingly, four different nasals, includingp and 1), this latter distinction not widely recognized as a feature of Afroasiatic. A side effect of this reconstruction is a first provisional history of the reflexes in Eastern Cushitic languages of PEC geminates. Along with this history, an explanation is proposed for the derivation of the Yaaku 7 -vowel system from the PEC system of 5 vowels, long and short.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The temary H vs. L vs. 0 distinction in the final syllable of the current language is traced back to a binary H vs. L contrast in Proto Bantu on the basis of two strata of reconstruction: first, a shallow one based on c. 200 PB cognates shared with the closely related Lacustrine languages Runyankore, Haya, and lita, and second, a deeper one based on c. 100 PB cognates shared with the more distantly related Congolese languages Tembo, Luba, and Lingala.

Tura has many tonal Patterns marking tense-aspect-mood-polarity distinctions that are characterized by a grammatical (""melodic"") H tone on different positions of the verb stem. The realization of melodic Hs depends on the prosody of the verb stem (number of syllables, syllable weight, C-initial vs. V initial) and complex interactions with H-toned prefixes. Some melodic Hs surface whether or not there is a H-toned prefix; others do not surface after a H toned prefix; and one surfaces only in combination with a H-toned prefix. Some melodic Hs block the H of the reflexive from surfacing; others are blocked from surfacing by the reflexive H; and another surfaces along with the reflexive H. The article describes and analyzes these and other cross-melody differences in the Tura tonal system as well as variation between two speakers of the dialect.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Like most other Kru languages, it displays harmony sensitive to pharyngeal constriction (tongue-root retraction). What gives the Klao vowel-harmony system special interest is the fact that a great deal of variation occurs, suggesting that vowel harmony is in some way optional. This provides a counter-example to the claim (made in Clements [1977l) that root-controlled vowel harmony is always obligatory. Given this optionality, the question arises as to which model best captures the facts of Klao vowel harmony. 'l,w frameworks are considered: one, along the lines of Anderson [1930], treats vowel harmony as one more assimilation rule, and the other, following the model found in Clements [1981] handles vowel harmony autosegmentally.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

This paper discusses the case of Supyire, a three tone language with downstep unrelated to low tone. Sequences of high tones are automatically downstepped. Confusion with mid tone is in most cases avoided by a rule which raises mid to high tone; the two rules together creating a ""flip-flop"" effect. Supyire also has automatic downdrift of mid and high tones following a low tone. It thus presents an unusual combination of downstep and downdrift in the same language, but unrelated to each other.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Three inherent aspect verb classes are established--events, processes, and states--on the basis of semantic and morphological distinctions. A fundamental opposition of the mood-aspect system is between factive and non-factive moods, which distinguish actual and potential situations. Non-factive mood is formally indicated by a high tone and subdivides into the categories subjunctive, predictive, and nonpredictive. Verbo-nominals are marked as non-factive. The formal categories of aspect are progressive, habitual, perfect, and nonperfect. When inherent and formal aspect categories with semantically contradictory components are combined, inherent aspect is overriden. The perfective meaning of the perfect category also overrides the imperfective meaning of the progressive.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Furthermore, the serial verb constructions will be shown to be far more productive and economical than the HTS constructions, the infinitival gerunds, and the a-ti complements; hence the former's gradual replacement of the latter, probably to suggest a direction of change (from relative complexity to relative simplicity and productivity); and lastly d. that it will become necessary to modify a portion of the orthography of the language to accomodate these new facts.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Proto-Bantu does not have such a series, nor do most East African Bantu languages. By contrast, three Bantu languages in northeastern Kenya (the northern Swahili dialects, Pokomo, Elwana) have acquired such a series, which thus merits explanation. There are three mechanisms involved: sounds along with loan vocabulary, (b) a simple phonological shift whereby inherited alveolars moved one place to become dental, and (c) a more complicated shift whereby inherited (pre) palatals bypassed an intervening alveolar series to become dental, a process little reported in the literature. It is hypothesised that these forms of denta1isation took place under historical conditions of contact with neighboring Cushitic communities--not the larger Eastern Cushitic communities of today (Somali, Orma), but rather the ancestral forms of what are now remnant languages, (probably) Southern Cushitic Dahalo and (possible) Eastern Cushitic Aweera.

However, this analysis fails in that it can only account for a small part of the distribution of these forms in actual texts. This paper suggests that meanings dealing with the speaker's relative concentration of attention on a referent are better able to account for the actual distribution of these forms. To validate this claim we will (1) show the relation of proximity to noteworthiness and thus explain the same range of data as the proximity hypothesis; (2) uncover other factors, e.g. new items, thematically important items, that override proximity and show their relation to noteworthiness to explain data not accounted for by the proximity hypothesis.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Madugu,Complex verbs in Nupe and Yoruba,1985,"This paper examines the structural behaviour of various types of complex verbs in Nupe and Yoruba in relation to causative constructions. When such verbs occur in simplex non-agentive causative sentences as well as in agentive non-causative sentences, they freely permit sentence embedding, resulting in biclausal causative structures. But in the case of non-agentive causatives, it is only Yoruba which allows the verbs to be irregularly embedded into causative matrix sentences in such a way that the biclausal causative structure constitutes input to Causative Clause Union, which compresses it into a uniclausal agentive causative sentence. Functionally, Yoruba uniclausal and biclausal agentive causatives are intercharigeable in many cases. On the other hand, only uniclausal agentive causatives are attested in Nupe, as Causative Clause Union has disappeared from its grammar. It is concluded that causative constructions in these languages demonstrate clearly that the CCU rule is motivated by a diachronic process of moving from a pragmatic mode of expression to a syntacticized one, and where a particular target has been hit, the rule ceases to function.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

However, if the matrix verb is other than mek, there is only one interpretation possible-without ""the fact that"".

The set of Proto-Bantu reconstructions contains multiple slightly divergent forms and/or meanings which supposedly have a common origin based on their strong resemblance, but which cannot be directly connected by means of established Bantu phonological shifts or known semantic shifts. The term ""osculance"" has been used to refer to this phenomenon. As a likely sign of non-ascertained dialectal variability and unknown historical relations at or even beyond the Proto-Bantu level, these ""osculant"" clusters deserve more detailed study. Prerequisite to detailed study of these clusters, however, is determination of the genuineness of the osculance.

A few text-building uses of the focus particles are discussed, namely, the use of subject focus in text-initial thetic sentences, the topic-shifting value of nominal focus, and the use of focus on a clausal or nominal adverbial as an action-enhancing device. In light of these considerations, it is argued that the nominal focus particles are perhaps better considered as generic ""foregrouding particles"".",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Within the Chadic language family, morphological palatalization is best documented in the Biu-Mandara branch, but it has been inherited as a feature in the West branch as well. This paper explores palatalization phenomena in the West Branch that conceivably trace their origin to morphological palatalization. In Miya, morphological palatalization operates much as it does in Biu-Mandara languages, affecting entire morphemes and associating with specific morphological processes. Duwai exhibits remnants of morphological palatalization in certain verb alternations. Bole shows alveolar/alveopalatal variations in specific lexical items that have no local phonological explanation. In Hausa, the origin of palatal consonants has long been a source of controversy. The paper argues that local phonological processes of palatalization cannot account for a large number of the palatals in modern Hausa, a claim that has implications for the analysis of the system of high vowels.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

One unusual feature of the system is the form ban( a), used to pluralize, for example, kin terms such as 'mother' and 'father' .

Not only has this grammatic ali zed form come to be used as a pluralizer, it also functions as a type of comitative marker.

Non-emphatic adjectives are also often ambiguous because of their inevitable incorporation of two copulas, one stative and neutral, the other active and cognate.

While Bondu-so has seven surface vowels, namely, two [+ATR, +high] vowels ([i], [u]), a [–ATR +low] vowel [a] and a [±ATR] contrast in the mid vowels with front [e]/[ɛ] and back [o]/[ɔ], there is evidence for a more abstract vowel system phonologically consisting of ten vowels with [±ATR] contrasts with all vowel heights. Further, the language shows a three-way contrast with respect to the feature [ATR] on suffixal vowels: some suffixal vowels act as [+ATR] dominant, spreading their [+ATR] feature onto the root; other suffixes act as [–ATR] dominant, spreading [–ATR] onto the root, and still other suffixes have vowels unspecified for [ATR] receiving their [±ATR] feature by rightward spreading of the [±ATR] value of the root vowel. We offer an autosegmental analysis and then discuss the theoretical implications of such an analysis. These implications include the ternary use of [ATR], the issue of phonological versus morphological harmony, the relationship between vowel inventories and [ATR] harmony systems, and the question of abstractness in phonology.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

By “inside”, I mean to compare prenominal relative clauses in the Ethiopian area in order to show how they are different from and/or similar to each other. By “outside”, I extend the comparison to beyond Ethiopian languages and include other African languages with or without prenominal relative clauses and languages from elsewhere with prenominal relative clauses. These comparisons will show to what extent Ethiopian prenominal relative clauses are typologically marked or ordinary. However, the inside comparison will be given more attention. Furthermore, synchronic comparison naturally leads us to questions concerning language evolution and language contact. These questions have always been in the center of studies of the Ethiopian Language Area and will be discussed here.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

It is shown that Tagbana has three level tones (L, M, H) and two floating tones (H) and (L). A mid tone (M) at the end of a noun is always followed by a floating tone (either H or L), which might be a historic trace left by the tone of a Class Marker. Two clusters of sandhi tonal rules are shown to play a role, called ‘Mid Replacement rules’ (RepM) and ‘Spreading rules on H &amp; L’ (SprH&amp;L). The domains of the sandhi tonal rules are studied in some detail, from the Minimal Prosodic Word (root + class marker), the Intermediate and Maximal Prosodic Words (nominal and adjectival compounds), the Prosodic Phrases (particularly in object + verb constructions), to the Intonational Phrase. Considering the prosodic levels above the Minimal Prosodic Word, more tonal sandhi processes are found to apply in smaller prosodic domains than in larger ones.&nbsp;",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Zaghawa, also called Beria in the literature, is a Saharan language of the Nilo-Saharan language phylum spoken in the border region of Sudan and Chad. Like other Saharan languages, it has complex verbal morphology including person indexing. The primary aim of the study is descriptive in that it presents linguistic data of the underdescribed Wagi dialect which is mainly spoken in Sudan. First, the paradigm of bound verbal affixes and their morphology is described. Secondly, one of the functions of the final morpheme of the verb which has not yet been described in detail in previous studies on Zaghawa is analysed. This final morpheme interacts with the person indexes to mark plural participants, and it is exploited to mark a morphological category not yet recognized in the other dialects of Zaghawa: the exclusive/inclusive distinction in the 1st person plural. Therefore, the study provides new data on the Zaghawa verb system and contributes a further detail to our knowledge of the Nilo-Saharan language family.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

We describe interactions between grammatical tense marking (and other sentential bounding elements) and lexical verb types, arguing for the salience of inchoative verbs, which lexically encode a resultant state, and, in particular, a sub-class of inchoative verbs, biphasal verbs, which encode both a resultant state and the “coming-to-be” phase leading up to that state. We further discuss other important features of actional classes in Xhosa and Southern Ndebele, including topics such as the role of participant structure and the relative importance of cross-linguistically prominent distinctions such as that between Vendlerian activities and accomplishments. Although differences between Xhosa and Southern Ndebele are evident both in the behaviour of individual tense-aspect forms and in the interpretive possibilities of specific verbs, the general patterns are quite similar. This similarity suggests that the patterns are likely to extend to other Nguni languages, as well, and that cross-linguistic comparison of particular lexical items across these languages are both feasible and likely to bear fruit.

Previous language-based approaches to the introduction and dispersal of this staple crop of Asian origin have suffered from the absence of well-established genealogical classifications and inadequate historical-linguistic analysis. We therefore focus in this article on West-Coastal Bantu (WCB), one specific branch within the Bantu family whose genealogy and diachronic phonology are well established. We reconstruct three distinct banana terms to Proto-West-Coastal Bantu (PWCB), i.e. *dɪ̀‑ŋkòndò/*mà‑ŋkòndò ‘plantain’, *dɪ̀‑ŋkò/*mà‑ŋkò ‘plantain’ and *kɪ̀‑túká/*bì‑túká ‘bunch of bananas’. From this new historical-linguistic evidence we infer that AAB Plantains, one of Africa’s two major cultivar subgroups, already played a key role in the subsistence economy of the first Bantu speakers who assumedly migrated south of the rainforest around 2500 years ago. We furthermore analyze four innovations that emerged after WCB started to spread from its interior homeland in the Kasai-Kamtsha region of Congo-Kinshasa towards the Atlantic coast, i.e. dɪ̀‑kòndè ‘plantain’, kɪ̀‑tébè ‘starchy banana’, banga ‘False Horn plantain’, and dɪ̀‑tòtò ‘sweet banana’. Finally, we assess the historical implications of these lexical retentions and innovations both within and beyond WCB and sketch some perspectives for future lexicon-based banana research.

The verbal system has different patterns based on the form of the verb.

For the perfectives we have L, H and HL while the imperfectives have LH, HL and H!H, at least in the dialect under study. I treat tone as a combination of the features [±upper] and [±raised] which are connected to what is described as a Tone node (T-node). These Tone nodes in turn connect to the syllable. Under this system, I assume L is represented with the features [-upper] and [-raised] and H with the features [+upper] [+raised]. Underlying tonal melodies of the root morphemes are identical to the surface tones of the perfective forms whether these contain an overt suffix or not. For the imperfectives, the suffix comes with an unspecified underlying T-node. The grammar then chooses the features [±upper] and [±raised] to insert under the already existing T-node. &nbsp;",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The nominal morphology is described in the context of two phenomena: number marking and noun classification. Leteh is a South-Guan language from the Niger-Congo family of languages. The morphology of Leteh is largely agglutinative. Güldemann and Fiedler (2019) argue that current analyses of gender systems are heavily influenced by those in Bantu languages and not cross-linguistically applicable. They propose an alternative analysis that includes the notions agreement class and nominal form class. In this paper I adopt the notion of nominal form class to classify nouns in Leteh. The nouns are grouped into four major classes based on the plural morphemes that they take. These classes are subdivided based on the singular forms with which they are paired.

The fact of Motion and Manner/Cause are incorporated in the verb root when lexicalizing complex location-motion events.

In nouns this depends on definiteness and the location of tone-accent in the citation form, while in verbs it is determined by the presence or absence of high tone-accent on the verb root and the type of suffix attached to it.

One is interpreted as HL, or falling-toned, the other as High-toned. The analysis represents a significant advance over the less highly structured view that a simple substitution algorithm replaces stresses with tones, e.g., High tone for-stressed syllables and Low tone for unstressed. This provides a boost for the status of the tonal foot as a prosodic constituent. The analysis also has implications for Hausa non-loan word phonology in that it suggests a natural reinterpretation of claims made by Newman and Jaggar [1989].",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The most recent attempt to set up a classification of Ethiopian-Semitic was Hetzron [1972}, but this work was rather thoroughly criticized by Goldenberg [1977], and the field has yet to recover from it. The present note seeks to open the classification question anew by providing a basic, minimalist classification scheme, which can serve as a starting-off point for any future work on the subject.

Cohen treats Tigre and Tigrinya as Northern Ethiopic, and Amharic, Harari, and the Gurage cluster as Southern Ethiopic. All are ultimately descendants of a ProtoEthiopic koine most closely resembling Ge'ez. Gurage, according to Cohen, is not a language or a linguistic unit in itself, but rather an ensemble of at least two separate and mutually unintelligible dialect clusters, Eastern Gurage and Western Gurage. Eastern Gurage consists of Wolane, Selti-Ulbarag, (and in the present state of our knowledge also Zway) , and is most closely connected with Harari. Western Gurage consists of several subgroups of dialects, in particular (a) Chaha, Ezha, Ennemor (Inor), Gumar, Gyeto (and in the present state of our knowledge Endegefi) and (b) Muher, Gogot, Masqan.

Most of the alternations manifested by the consonantal segments of this language are in accordance with general phonological principles. Nevertheless, there are some apparently complex alternations that may not be sufficiently accounted for using simple phonetic logic, and that exhibits some typological novelties, which may be of some theoretical interest to specialists in the field. Moreover, the underlying consonant system of this language constitutes a typological curiosity rarely documented in the world's languages.

Although Pari could be analyzed as having three basic tone levels and automatic downstep, there is morphological evidence that it has two basic tone levels and non-automatic downstep.

A striking finding of this research is that morphological footing is independent of metrical footing in many languages, as the footing required for particular morphological processes is often not identical to that required for phonological processes like stress assignment. However, recent OT research on Prosodic Morphology has made the opposite claim. Within this theory, the Generalized Template Hypothesis (GTH) proposes that no morpheme-particular templates defining minimal and maximal size are necessary. Instead, templates are always derivable from general principles of the grammar, like independently motivated metrical footing. This paper presents evidence from Ndebele showing that the GTH is too strong. In Ndebele, several different verb forms are subject to a minimality condition. In some cases, the minimality condition can be derived through independent metrical footing, as the GTH predicts. However, in several cases it cannot, showing that morpheme-particular size constraints are still a necessary part of the grammar.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

10.32473/sal.v30i1.107363,David Odden,Tone shift and spread in Taita I,2001,"Numerous Bantu languages have processes of rightward shift or spread of H tone. Sometimes the process is quite simple: every H shifts once to the right (as in Cijita) or spreads once to the right (as in Kikerewe). The tonal system of Taita is more complex in that both shifting and spreading are found in the language. Furthermore, the extent of tone shift or spread is not just one syllable; sometimes, H tone can shift or spread by two syllables. An analysis of the tonal system of the Dembwa dialect of Taita is given here. It is argued that the facts of the language are best described in terms of two rules of rightward spreading and a third rule of tone delinking. The argument for analyzing the tone system in terms of three interacting rules rather than one unified rightward movement process resides in the fact that the environments for the three processes only overlap partially. On the theoretical front, these results support a general decomposition of the process of tone shift into tone spread interacting with tonal delinking, rather than including the operation of shift in the formal repertoire of primitive phonological operations.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

This study focuses on the following problems. First, there is a phonetic contrast, found only at the end of the utterance, between the downgliding L of eket and the unreleased L of basemo. Unreleased L will be shown to derive from rising tone. Second, I argue that syllable final consonants may be tone-bearing, a claim supported by analysis of tone alternations resulting from postlexical resyllabification. Third, Kenyang uses floating L prefixes to form morphological verb tense distinctions. There is a behavioral contrast between the free L tone marking the progressive, which triggers downstep and blocks a spreading rule, versus the free L used in the recent past, which docks to the first root vowel, thereby causing the root tone to shift rightward. The analytic problem is to find a way to represent these two types of floating L. The distinction can be handled by assigning them to different levels of the lexical phonology, so that the shift-inducing L is added when verb roots are inserted, but the float-only L is added at a later stratum-. Finally, I show that the interaction between the two rules H Spreading and Fall Simplification provides evidence for the cyclic application of postlexical rules.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Among the arguments presented is a claim that palatalization of coronal obstruents in Hausa is a cyclic rule, but one applying only to derived words, not stems. It is further demonstrated that Hausa makes use of rules which in parallel fashion delete syllable nuclei occurring directly preceding syllable nuclei, and syllable appendices occurring directly preceding syllable appendices.

One way in which plural is marked syntactically is by certain plural words. The plural word can either interpret the noun as plural directly as in the case of àwọn and quantifying words such as púpọ̀ ‘many’ and méjì ‘two’; or it can be realized on a primitive adjective (in the form of COPY) or on a demonstrative (in the form of wọ̀n-). Such elements in turn make available the plural interpretation of the noun they modify. The paper proposes that these plural words possess a covert or an overt [PLURAL] feature, which percolates onto the NP. This analysis of plural marking predicts that there are two ways by which languages may (overtly) mark their nouns for plural cross-linguistically. Languages like Yorùbá, which do not show agreement, mark plural syntactically and make use of a plural feature percolation mechanism, while languages like English, which show agreement, mark plural morphologically and use a plural feature-matching mechanism. It further demonstrates that in Yorùbá, an NP can be freely interpreted as singular or plural in specific discourse context and proposes a general number analysis to account for this type of case. As to the syntax of these plural words, It is proposed that like other non-morphological plural marking languages (e.g., Halkomelem (British Columbia, Canada) as in Wiltschko 2008), Yorùbá plural words are adjuncts that are adjoined to the host head (noun or modifier/demonstrative).",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The outcome of this alternation, although transparent, cannot be captured in a standard constraint-based optimality theoretic framework and instead requires machinery employed to address surface opacity. This paper illustrates that the result of competing pressures to remain faithful to the underlying segmental structure, as well as to a consonant’s specification for [voice], is the seemingly transparent but analytically opaque retention of marked structure. We illustrate that this type of cumulative faithfulness is best addressed via one of two evaluative mechanisms capable of capturing additive effects, namely Local Constraint Conjunction and Harmonic Grammar.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

More information on the interaction of these elements will be relevant for the understanding of the latter’s function. I further show that there is co-occurrence restrictions between ka/n and post verbal la, as has been claimed by earlier research.

While the structure of infinitival complement clauses is analogous to that found in many languages, other types of complement clauses present unique morpho syntactic features. Some dependent constructions are introduced by complementizers which agree in person and number with the subject of the main clause. These complementizers derive from personal possessive pronouns rather than from the verb of saying, as is the case in some Bantu languages, and they have other functions besides introducing embedded clauses. Other clauses disallow complementizers and the verb shows no temporal reference, coding either the perfect or progressive aspect. The interpretation of time in such clauses is dependent on that of the main clause.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

A salient feature of tone in the language is a covert lexical distinction between words with final H versus those with no final tone. Phrasal tone alternations provide ample evidence allowing the recovery of this underlying distinction. The language also has a process of rightward H tone shift, also found in languages such as lita and Dembwa Taita. In contrast to Dembwa Taita, where language-internal evidence clearly indicates that surface shift is the result of general spreading and restricted de linking, the patterns of spread and delinking in Mbololo Taita are perfectly matched, so that there is no synchronic evidence for a two-step account of tone shift.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Rules of tone spread and deletion apply to low tones rather than high tones, and the ""default low insertion"" rule of other languages is replaced in Ruwund by a rule adding default high tones. This finding is theoretically significant in that it contradicts Pulleyblank's [1986] proposal that ""low"" is always the default value in a two-tone language.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Two distinct mutation patterns are isolated. The first consists of a voiced stop--voiceless stop--prenasalized stop set of alternations, while the second is a Fula-like pattern consisting of continuant-stop-pre nasalized stop alternations. Consonant mutation is shown to be the result of the prefixation of a class marker that contains a floating autosegment which associates to an underspecified stem-initial consonant. Both mutation patterns occur in the same morphological environments, thereby presenting a potential problem for an auto segmental analysis: e.g., How can we account for the occurrence of continuants and voiced stops in the same environment? By positing different underlying forms for each of the mutation patterns we show how consonant mutation in Seereer is quite complex but also more regular than previously thought.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

It is generally assumed that this shortening is characteristic of word-ends such that the process can even serve as a criterion for phonological word division. Despite the attention given to final vowel shortening (FVS), the relevant facts have not been exhaustively described. In this descriptive account, we show that FVS is a much more complex phenomenon than the Luganda literature suggests. We observe, for instance, that FVS does not work the same on nouns as it does on verbs and that an empirically adequate analysis must take into account the source of such word-final length, e.g. underlying vs. derived. In our solution, FVS first applies at the end of a phonological word (PW) and then again at the end of a clitic group (CG). In order for the facts to fall out from this analysis, we argue that at the PW level (1) the final vowel of verb forms is not affected because it is extrametrical, i.e. ""invisible"" and (2) the second mora of a monosyllabic stem is not affected because it is accented.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Verb stems all select a single H tone, which is then mapped to some stem vowel, or is deleted, depending on the tense of the verb. Theoretical issues arise in the course of the investigation. The question of adjacency constraints in phonology is raised: Meeussen's Rule in Makonde requires that the involved tones be in adjacent syllables, although they need not be on adjacent morae. We also find evidence for treating the final syllable as extratonal.

An underlying high tone may surface normally as high, but unexpectedly as low, or high-falling; while underlying low tones surface as high, high-falling, or normally as low. For this reason the low tone verb can have a L(L), HL, or even H(H) surface melody while the high tone verbs can be L(H), HL, or H(H). Accounting for these melodies in order to reconstruct the underlying forms is necessary for a proper understanding of the Babanki verb tone in particular and the tonal system of Centre Ring Grassfields Bantu languages in general.

Two primary findings emerge. Across Africa, basic directional motion tends to be verb-framed with respect to direction; it conflates the semantic components Motion+Direction in verbs equivalent to 'enter, circle, traverse'. Manner of motion, while maintaining this lexicalization pattern, syntactically registers a Motion+Direction verb and its linear order relative to a Manner verb through either of two primary strategies. Manner precedes Motion+ Direction when the two verbs are conveyed through serial verb sequences, verb compounding, or verb coordination.

Two patterns in the three-way typology are identified. In the alternational pattern neither language dominates the other, whilst the insertional pattern involves asymmetry in the roles of the two languages, with Igbo as the matrix language that provides the morphosyntactic structure of the bilingual clause. Certain structural features of the Igbo morphosyntactic frame are identified as evidence of a matrix-embedded language asymmetry. In particular, it is demonstrated that the feature of morphosyntactic integration serves as the diagnostic for identifying the type of codeswitching within a clause and that it effectively distinguishes alternation and insertion, especially in peripheral switching. In the insertional pattern, the Igbo grammatical frame forces morphological integration of inserted English verbs but in the alternational pattern, verbs remain monolingual in the participating languages. The paper concludes that although the two patterns are attested in the Igbo-English language pair, the insertional pattern is dominant.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Among other things, it is observed that in Nkami’s RCCs both the head noun and its referent within the relative clause (RC) are explicitly stated, save when the referent is inanimate in non-subject function. Thus, Nkami is among the very few languages that employ the pronoun retention strategy to obligatorily state relativized NPs in subject position within RCs. It also departs from the norm of some Kwa linguists by recognizing a marker, which is similar in distribution and function to what is so-called ‘Clause (final) Determiner (CD)’, as a Relative Marker (cf. Lefebvre 1993, Saah 2010). Hence, Nkami’s RCC is couched as one that employs a ‘bracket strategy’, where two enclosing relative makers are simultaneously placed at the ends of the RC (cf. Kuteva and Comrie 2005). Moreover, unlike most Kwa languages, the head noun is never flanked by a definite determiner.

Whereas assimilatory dominance of [+ATR] vowels is highly characteristic of the former, [-ATR] dominance is more typical of the latter. This paper investigates some further differences in the characteristic patterning of the two systems. I present evidence that /2IU/ and /1IU/ systems show essentially opposite markedness relations in respect to their non-low vowels, as diagnosed by distributional restrictions and positional neutralization. In /2IU/ systems it is quite common for [-ATR] vowels [ɪ], [ʊ], [ɛ], [ɔ] to be more widely distributed than their [+ATR] counterparts [i], [u], [e], [o], suggesting that the former are unmarked. In contrast, /1IU/ systems characteristically treat [-ATR] [ɪ], [ʊ], [ɛ], [ɔ] as marked relative to their [+ATR] counterparts.

This article examines their origin. Proto-Berber originally had a single mid vowel *e, which appears to have been retained in Siwi only before word-final /n/. In all other environments the contrast between *i and *e has been neutralized, although word-finally this contrast seems to have survived into the 19th century. Instances of /e/ in other environments are phonetically conditioned, deriving variously from *i, *ăy, or *ă in appropriate contexts. The few attestations of /o/ are irregular, but occur in environments paralleling those in which /e/ is attested synchronically.

Thus, the variation in the structures of Bantu relative clauses can be accounted for if we understand that there is a parametric variation in the position in which RelP projects; lower than TP or higher than TP.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Using Ewe (Gbe), Likpe (Na-Togo) and Akan (Tano) as exemplars, I demonstrate that these languages have trivalent predicates and various constructions in which a single verb hosts three arguments in a clause. The languages deploy three-place predicate, adpositional, SVC, and adnominal strategies to code three-participant situations. I argue that there are semantic differences between the various constructions. The hyper-transitivity of these languages might account for the presence of three-place predicate constructions.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Some languages have grammaticalized only the indirect object predication; others have grammaticalized the indirect object and the benefactive predication; and still other languages have not grammaticalized either of the predications, leaving the relevant semantic relations to be inferred from the coding of other predications. In the sample selected there are no languages that have grammaticalized the benefactive but not the indirect object predication. The study also demonstrates the consequences of the grammaticalization of indirect object and benefactive predications: A predication whose verb inherently indicates the presence of an indirect object or benefactive complement requires fewer formal means than a predication whose verb does not inherently imply the presence of an indirect object or benefactive complement. This generalization does not apply to a language that has not grammaticalized either type of predication. The theoretical approach in the present study differs significantly from the usual discussions of related phenomena subsumed under the terms of ‘ditransitive’, ‘three argument verbs’, and ‘datives'.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Each relation is grammatically expressed by a common morphophoneme. Postverbal particle li/ni marks Emai dative constituents. In addition, li/ni codes a limited range of subordinate clause types within complex sentences, and within noun phrases it designates a subset of modifying constituents. To bridge the common formal marking across these structural relations, we postulate their identification of a semantic ground type (within a figure-ground complex) characterized by spatial collectivity and temporal continuity. Our overall conclusion thus pertains to the function of perspective taking in grammar and its formal marking (Talmy 2000), with special emphasis placed on the dative relation.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

For a restricted set of nouns, gender is immutably based on lexical semantic features. Other nouns are lexically neutral, or have a default gender specification which can be overridden by the speaker's construal of the referent as small/ female, large/male, or pejorative. Varying by the noun, either of the productive genders may convey a pejorative construal, though it is most common in the feminine.

Although select clauses and phrases from Swahili support Nichols' claim, a closer examination of the data reveals an interesting variety of morphosyntactic marking in Swahili as well as in two other Bantu languages, Kikuyu and Chewa. Function words playa key role in marking genitive, instrumental, and locative relations in these languages. Function words also regularly occur as markers of object noun phrases with animate referents.

Non-restrictives, in contrast, are (for many speakers) distinguished from restrictives as follows: (1) they are introduced by a distinctive all L tone allomorph of the explicit relativizing pronoun wanda/wadda/waa anda; and (2) some speakers also allow either the same focus form of the !NFL as occurs in restrictives, or use the neutral non-focus (sun, suna, etc.) form as a possible alternative.

This lack, however, may be related to another continent-wide areal phenomenon: there is a paucity of morphological NP case marking according to either ergative or accusative typologies. It is thus possible that other more subtle attributes of the ergative organization of syntax are what should be sought in Africa. For example, in the Mande languages, as also in Celtic, phonological decay has produced a series of word initial consonant alternations. In Celtic these have come to function as part of a nominative-accusative case marking strategy. The situation is quite similar in Mande, but as this paper details for Lorna, the noun case system is ergative-absolute.

Instead these segments are shown to be composed of a phonetic sequence of a labial articulation and an alveolar one. The analysis of the ""labial-alveolars"" as a sequence of phonological elements is also shown to be appropriate. If they are viewed as unitary segments represented by a single matrix of features there are problems with selecting correct feature values. If they are represented as two feature matrices linked to a single segmental position an invalid distinction is introduced between this representation and the same two matrices linked to separate segmental positions. On the other hand, representation as two independent segments accounts for vowel length adjustments and for resyllabification.

As Goldsmith, Peterson, and Drogo [1986] and Peterson [1989b] have argued, a metrical tone shift rule best accounts for the fact that the rightmost high tone in most words surfaces on the antepenult. Not all high tones shift to the antepenult, however; instead, they shift one syllable to the right. Earlier metrical analyses accounted for (some) of these cases by proposing rules of accent shift. The present analysis accounts for all these cases by a local tone shift rule ordered before accent assignment. This approach not only is more general and more natural than the accent shift analyses, but it also straightforwardly accounts for a number of tonal phenomena which were inadequately treated in earlier analyses.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The fact that labialization before round vowels is generally not very audible is explained in terms of a principle of speech perception.

In some cases low tones are lost completely while in other cases underlying low tones are manifested phonetically as downstep tones or as the low of a falling glide. The net result of Bandi tone rules is to create considerable opacity with respect to low tones. Second, is the treatment of polarizing tones. In Bandi, polarization rules cannot merely create a new tone, but must assign tone height to an underlying tone of unspecified tone height. Finally, there are fonnal problems that result from adherence to the OCP. A rule of tonal dissimilation becomes unduly complicated if it is assumed that the OCP prohibits sequences of like tones.

And if it has intrinsic sources of trouble, then it will have a mechanism for dealing with them intrinsically. I further argue that an adequate theory of the organisation of conversation in natural language in general, as proposed by Schegloff et al.

In Senegal, the dominant language is Wolof, a Senegambian language that is part of a different subgroup of Atlantic languages.

The most prevalent shape for Avokaya verbs is monosyllabic. Disyllabic verbs roots behave the same way as disyllabic verbs which are composed of a derivational prefix plus a monosyllabic verb root. The derivational prefixation process is the same for verbs in all grammatical constructions. Verbs in SVO constructions and SOV constructions are treated separately, since different rules apply for these two sets of constructions. Avokaya syllables may carry a high, mid, low or rising tone, but not a falling tone. In this analysis of Avokaya, we show that the expected HL tone pattern has merged to form a M tone in the verbal system.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

There are different types of separation events. “Cutting” and “breaking” events involve a non-reversible change in object integrity and have been systematically researched cross-linguistically in recent times (Guerssel et al 1985; Bohnemeyer 2008; Majid et al. 2008; Schaefer and Egbokhare 2012). In this paper, some of the generalisations that have been made concerning CUT and BREAK verbs are tested based on data from Tafi, a Ghana-Togo Mountain language. I investigate the morpho-syntactic properties of Tafi CUT and BREAK verbs in relation to a suggested generalisation by Guerssel et al. that BREAK verbs have a transitive/intransitive argument structure and participate in the causative/inchoative alternation; while CUT verbs are transitive and they are not expected to occur without their external argument. The types of events referred to by the CUT and BREAK verbs and the combinatorial capacity of the individual verbs are also explored. Based on an analysis of stimulus-elicitations and spontaneous language performances recorded in the field, I show that the Tafi verb bhui ‘cut’ can be used in an intransitive/resultative construction in which the theme, the internal argument, occurs as the subject. Drawing on the behaviour of bhui ‘cut’ I interrogate the explanations that have been offered in the literature with respect to such deviations from the generalisation. I argue that the verb argument alternation potential of a verb depends on the verb semantics as well as the type of (internal) argument it collocates with. Moreover, I explore the semantic interpretations of the verb when it combines with non-typical objects such as ‘water’. I show that such patterns and collocations such as ‘the water cut’ = ‘the water stopped running’, ‘cut a village’ = ‘establish a village’ are areal in nature (cf. Huttar et al. 2007).",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

This article presents examples illustrating the expression of various kinds of speaker judgments of participants through the use of anaphoric demonstratives.

10.32473/sal.v47i1.107653,Toni Cook,The inclusion of prefixal material in Zulu reduplication,2018,"The aim of this paper is twofold: to introduce new data that show reduplication in Zulu admits inflectional morphemes to the left of the verb stem rather than within the stem on the right, and to give an analysis of Zulu reduplication that does not require access to underlying morphosyntactic structure. Instead, reduplication is a template-filling copying operation that interacts with linear phonological structures and does not target morphosyntactic objects. The data presented here argue for an analysis in which the crucial distinction is between morphemes within the scope of reduplication and those outside it; the left/right asymmetry in the appearance of inflectional morphemes in the reduplicant is attributable to a process of Local Dislocation (Embick 2007). Reduplication is treated as a copying operation that has indirect access only to morphosyntactic structure through phonological operations. Consequently, reified subconstituents of the verb complex, such as the Macrostem (Hyman, Inkelas, and Sibanda 2009), are not accessible as such to the process of reduplication. However, data from VCV stems show that morphosyntactic structure affects reduplication in certain constructions. Tonal data is used to show that the “prefixal” affiliation of prefixal morphemes is voided if these morphemes are reduplicated.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Where nouns are morphologically marked for number, the affix and not the root determines gender, leading to the type of gender polarity more commonly observed in Semitic. More unusually, and more controversially, the semantic basis of the third gender appears to be plurality. ‘Plural gender’ has been argued to exist in some Cushitic languages, but has never previously been documented outside that family.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Wolof noun classification is examined within the comparative context of its two closest sister languages, Pulaar and Seereer-Siin, and is shown to contrast with them in that the disappearance of class prefixes did not entail their replacement by suffixes. Finally, an argument is made that noun class systems like that of Wolof which appear to be somewhat incoherent from a semantic point of view are actually typical because noun classification is not only an artifact of the human mind, but also an artifact of human language.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

On the basis of the distribution of null objects in causative constructions, it is argued that the pro analysis provides a more elegant account of the facts of Akan than does the argument analysis. Akan is therefore analyzed as a pro-drop, or null subject, language, permitting null pronominal subjects under certain circumstances.

As these grammemes are final to their noun hosts, they are markedly distinct from canonic prefix morphology in Bantu nouns. Moreover, nominal syntagms are head-initial and canonic grammaticalization in this domain can be expected to yield prefixes. The elements under discussion are suffixes, yet they developed in Bantu from inherited nominal lexemes. Thus, they are unusual from a morphotactic viewpoint and cannot easily be accounted for by exclusively language-internal developments. For this reason, it is plausible to investigate the hypothesis that the nominal suffixes emerged due to interference from languages having a different grammatical structure. For this purpose, a sample of non-Bantu languages from the relevant geographic area in Africa is established and analyzed in order to test whether there are languages or entire groups with head-final and suffixing patterns that could have influenced the process of suffix emergence in Bantu.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Because these Bantu languages do not allow nasalized vowels, it is necessary to view such assimilation as operating ""at a distance"" [Poser 1983], with the intervening vowel(s) being transparent. Transvocalic nasal consonant harmony (NCR) is widespread within Bantu [Greenberg 1951], and was repeatedly cited by phonologists in the 1970's, e.g., from Luba [Howard 1972, Johnson 1972] and Lamba [Kenstowicz and Kisseberth 1979]. In this paper I treat a more extensive and dramatic case of NCR at a distance in Yaka, a language spoken in Zaire. In this language /-Vd-/ suffixes are realized [-Vn-] even when the triggering nasal consonant is not in the immediately preceding syllable, e.g., /-miituk-id-/ 'sulk for' ~ [miituk-in-] (cf. Ao [1991], Piggott [1993] and Odden [1994], who cite parallel facts from Kongo). I begin by documenting the pervasiveness of the (stem-level) nasal harmony effects in the language, which therefore require a phonological analysis (vs. one involving allomorphy). Discussion centers around the problem of why voiceless and prenasalized consonants should be transparent to NCR.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The present paper is a description of Avatime phonology, with emphasis on certain features which have been poorly described and/or are of general linguistic interest. Within the consonant system, Avatime has bilabial fricatives and a full series of labiovelar obstruents, including fricatives. Consonants with following glides are considered to be segment sequences rather than consonants with secondary articulations. The vowel system has nine vowels with [ATR] harmony. Continguous vowels undergo a variety of coalescence processes, which differ depending on morphological context and the specific vowels involved. Modem Avatime requires an analysis with four contrasting level tones. However, many instances of two of these tones (the highest level and the lower mid level) are derived through still active processes.

Among other distinctions, some adverbs can function as nominal tense/aspect markers within a determined nominal phrase (DP). Though the origins of all adverbs cannot be traced, the paper documents sources in oblique prepositional phrases, relational nouns, adjectives, relative clauses, and perhaps infinitive verbs, involving a wide range of lexical roots, such as ‘little’, ‘paint, mark’, ‘be abundant (with grass), be generous’, and others.

It is here assumed that speakers of such languages can still signal to the hearer when they refer to unique and identifiable referents. This paper contributes to the long-standing cross-linguistic question of how bare nouns are interpreted and what means languages without articles have to disambiguate between definite and indefinite readings. This question is largely unexplored for Bantu languages. The answer is sought in the use of different word orders and morphosyntactic constructions, with a focus on the existential in this paper. In many languages of the world, there is a restriction on definites as pivots in existential constructions, serving as a motivation for exploring these constructions in Xhosa. Xhosa makes use of a non-verbal copula in prototypical existentials as well as predicate locatives, to express the existence or presence of a referent. The paper argues that the existential is used for inactive referents and the predicate locative for (semi-) active referents. The inactive referents of the existential are mainly indefinite referential or non-referential. The active referents of the predicate locative are referential indefinite or definite. There is no absolute definiteness effect in the existential. A further motivation for this study is the occurrence of this copula in a short and a long form, giving rise to four different structures. The paper reveals an unexpected analogy between the use of the short and long form and the use of the so called conjoint and disjoint forms in Xhosa tense-aspect paradigms.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

One, like the relative pronouns, typically ends with /o/ and the other, like the subject agreement affixes, are never /o/ final. According to the traditionalists, a semantic feature associated with /o/ differentiates two sets of clitics semantically as well as phonetically. The present account argues that the two sets do not form separate morphemes. They are instead allomorphs of the same morpheme derived by a phonological rule, o-Epenthesis, which suffixes /o/ onto any constituent final pronominal clitic. This virtually exceptionless account provides synchronic evidence for a dual constituent analysis of the verbal complex. The discussion of such well known forms adopts basic assumptions from lexical and auto segmental phonology.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The arguments presented refer to word order, object concord (or pronominal copy) and the interaction between object concord and some syntactic phenomena such as passivization, topicalization, relativization, and clefting.

A pervasive contrast of secondary articulations on consonants spreads features of rounding and backness to contiguous vowels, giving rise to the different high vowel qualities recognized by Hoffman. A morphological role for the secondary articulations can be identified. Given this new understanding of the vowel system, the claim that ""labio-coronal"" elements in Margi are single complex segments requires reevaluation. Arguments advanced by Sagey [1986] are shown to proceed from a wrong interpretation of a syncope process and an assumed underlying contrast between high vowels.

This difference is responsible for the morphological manifestation of number on all the constituents of a nominal phrase in French but on only one constituent in Dagara and English. Besides, the paper claims that the difference between Dagara and English in number marking is in the syntactic position of number and that this difference explains why the plural marker is always on nouns but not on adjectives in English.

Non-linear morphology does not appear on the root, but rather occurs within pre-verbal units called STAMP markers or STAMP portmanteaux, a mnemonic for subject agreement, tense, aspect, mood, and polarity. Based on the previous description of Ebira morphosyntax, this paper decomposes its STAMP markers into several sub-STAMP morphs. Specifically, inflectional categories for subject agreement (1S, 2, 3S, 1P, 3P), aspect/mood (HABITUAL, COMPLETIVE, SUBJUNCTIVE, CONTINUOUS, PERFECT), polarity (NEGATIVE), and clause-level meanings (INTERROGATIVE, 'IF', 'WHEN') are decomposed into various floating tones, floating moras, and unassociated segments. By decomposing STAMPs in this way, it makes testable predictions for future Ebira studies, as not all logically possible category combinations have been investigated yet. This paper concludes by discussing the areality of STAMP markers in West and Central Africa (the so-called Macro-Sudan Belt), which is complicated by analytic vs. synthetic transcription practices by linguists. In order to circumvent issues of transcription, I propose that the areality of STAMP markers in Africa be based on whether the individual STAMP categories form a constituent before and to the exclusion of the verb root, requiring explicit evidence independent from transcription practices.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

This claim is based on the observation that some suffixes alternate in [ATR] in agreement with a preceding root, while other sufflxes surface as either [+ATR] or [-ATR], regardless of the context in which they occur. The claim that non-alternating suffixes are specified for [ATR] is supported by the fact that they cause regressive assimilation: a [-ATR] root surfaces as [+ATR] if followed by a [+ATR] sufflx; a [+ATR] mid vowel root surfaces as [-ATR] if followed by a [-ATR] suffIX.

Of particular interest is the additional fact that an underlyingly low vowel surfaces as [-low], [-ATR] in certain [+ATR] environments. To explain these alternations, it will be argued that low vowels are underlyingly unspecified for vocalic features. Redundancy rules, supplied for the most part by Universal Grammar, interact with the vowel harmony system and rules of syllabification to derive the non-low variants of under1yingly low vowels.

On each level specific groups of morphemes are affixed and the resultant derived words undergo defined sets of phonological processes. On Level 1 a feature filling [±ATR] harmony rule applies, in which the [ATR] feature spreads bi-directionally from the principal root vowel across the root and all Level 1 affixes. However, there are also localized disharmonic domains created by phonologized co-articulation effects of consonants and dissimilation rules for vowels. On Level 2, suffixation of Tense-Mood-Aspect (TMA) markers at the right edge of the verbal complex triggers [+ATR] feature spreading leftward across the derived word. On Level 3 affixation does not trigger [ATR] harmony processes, and both affix vowels and the derivational complexes to which they are added retain their [ATR] features. Some Karimojong affixes exhibit behaviors characteristic of two different levels, depending on context; these affixes are proposed to be in transition between levels. The three levels are proposed to result from diachronic evolution, and their relative chronological development can be established by (1) correspondences to landmarks within the cross-linguistically attested agreement system grammaticalization cline, which groups affixes according to ordering universals, and (2) the existence of successive evolutionary cycles of frequentive morphology. A model of the morphology-phonology interface is proposed in which linguistic structure internal to the morpheme channels the spread of [ATR] features. The model provides an explanation for surface irregularities that originated at the time of areal vowel mergers in Nilotic languages (Dimmendaal, 2002).",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

To resolve this dilemma, a comparative analysis of color term reference in the Sotho languages is undertaken.

Finally, two other regional stems with less historical depth are reconstructed for the Great Lakes area and the central African forest region, respectively.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

However, the tenth vowel, hi, does not function as the harmonic counterpart of the low [-ATR] central vowel lal in affixes as it does in other ten vowel languages with crossheight vowel harmony systems. Rather, in some instances Ia! alternates with lei in [+ATR] contexts, while in other instances it surfaces invariably as lal in both [-ATR] and l +ATR] contexts. Formant measurements show the [+ATR] central vowel occupying the mid area of acoustic space, thus adding some support to the view that [+ATR] central vowels in ATR harmony systems are phonetically nonlow rather than low, the more widely-assumed position. Although vowel harmony applies to a significant number of affixes, especially in the verb morphology, there are interesting limitations on how far harmony extends.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

In declarative and relative clauses, the presence of the object pronoun does not require a definite interpretation of the object noun; the absence of the object pronoun does not preclude a definite interpretation of the object noun. In both cleft and pseudo-cleft constructions, however, the object pronoun obligatorily functions to grammatically mark clef ted and pseudo-clef ted objects as definite. In the cleft constructions, the definiteness of the clef ted NP forces a contrastive interpretation. Thus, a judgement concerning the function of this grammatical construction with regard to contrastive function will be made on the basis of the distribution of the syntactic category object pronoun. possible to make the same judgment. Contrastive function is unambiguously signaled by the relative morphology on the verb of the pseudo-cleft.

Because of this resemblance, it has been speculated that ‘Dorobo’ might have been a fourth, now extinct Kuliak language (e.g. Heine 1976). Unfortunately, this notion has persisted in the literature up to recent times. This paper examines the information found in Wayland 1931 from several perspectives to argue that ‘Dorobo’ was at most a dialect of Ik, not a separate language. From an anthropological perspective, the ‘Wanderobo’ that Wayland described match in many ways the Ik of today. From a sociolinguistic perspective, the Ik living today in the area visited by Wayland are often mixed with members of other neighboring tribes, such as the Dodoth or Toposa (Eastern Nilotic). Thus it is likely that the Ik were mixed up with them in the 1930s as well. Furthermore, the linguistic data may be unreliable: Wayland was not a linguist, and his transcriptions were adversely affected by having been acquired through interpreters speaking only broken Swahili. These three strands of evidence coincide to render the 1931 document insufficient evidence on which to establish a ‘Dorobo’ language.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

In another task, we gave speakers nominal forms and asked them to deconstruct them to the constituent serial verbs from which they were derived. Time and again, speakers gave, not only the serial verbs, but also the non-verbal elements even though they were not asked to do so. Gestalt meanings were also given by speakers when asked the meanings of individual elements. Thus, the semantic integration and lexicalization that takes place in full lexicalized-integrated serial verb constructions extends not only to serial verbs but also to these non-verbal elements which, to native speakers, seem to form just as important a part of the SVC as the verbal elements.

Basic word order stands as no exception to this generalization, and there have been partisans for both an SOV and an SVO reconstructed word order. Gensler 1994 attempts to reconcile the two by claiming that neither proposal is correct; he suggests that both SOY and SVO are derived from Proto-Niger-Congo *S-AUX-O-V-Other. Because of the pattern's ""quirkiness"" (being found virtually nowhere else in the world) and because it is so widely attested in geographically widely separated Niger-Congo languages, the pattern should be reconstructed for all of Niger-Congo. One crucial piece of evidence for this claim comes from the Southern Atlantic language Kisi. This paper explores Kisi' s facts in further detail to show how central the structure is to the language. It then expands the investigation to other languages of Atlantic, finding that the pattern is much more widely attested than was previously realized, albeit in an attenuated form.

For Kitharaka, I argue that wh-movement is triggered by a strong [+focus] feature in a functional head (Foc). The strong [+focus] feature on a focus head is morphologically manifested by a focus marker which attaches to a fronted wh-phrase, and in case of long wh-movement, by the focus markers that may appear on embedded clauses crossed by overt wh-movement. Wh-in situ occurs when no strong [+focus] features are introduced in the syntax (Muriungi 2003,2004).",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

When the semantics of a verb combines with the semantics of its internal arguments, different interpretations are derived.

Using data collected from written texts, video-stimuli descriptions, spontaneous utterances and native-speaker intuitions, this paper explores the potential combinatorial patterns of twá ‘to cut’ in Asante-Twi (Akan, Kwa-Niger Congo). I show that the verb combines with different types of internal arguments, in different argument structure constructions to derive multiple interpretations. Taking into consideration the fact that “natural language tries to minimize polysemy” (Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2013: 2), I propose a univocal lexical semantics for twá ‘to cut’ and show that its basic semantics is kept constant even in non-prototypical contexts. I argue that the use of twá ‘to cut’ in non-prototypical contexts represent contextual modulations of the verb’s single meaning. Following Spalek (2015) and Ameka (2019), I suggest that such contextual interpretations should be analysed compositionally, paying attention to the verb’s internal arguments as well as the argument structure constructions in which it occurs.

These forms of communication may be formal or informal depending on the setting, people involved, age and class. Codeswitching is an informal form of communication. It is used most at times in oral communication. However, in recent times, its has been used extensively in written communication. This has raised issues as to whether written communication can also be a possible platform for informal communication. This study investigates codeswitching on public signage by Kiswahili –English bilinguals. The study examines how Kiswahili –English bilinguals use the two languages on public signage by structurally analysing how Kiswahili and English words are distributed in a given mixed constituent. To achieve this, Kiswahili-English codeswitched data was gathered from tokens of public signage from Kenya specifically, Nairobi. Using the Matrix Language Frame Model of Myers-Scotton, the study observes that theories propounded for oral codeswitching data could be used to analyse written communication (public signage texts) data because writers adhere to the syntax of both Kiswahili and English as stipulated by the tenets of the Matrix Language Frame Model. This is possible when the aim is to solely look at text items on public signage without keen considerations to the graphics therein that is, if the analysis is based purely on syntax. The study therefore recommends that the importance of codeswitching especially on public signage is evidence of how language is used and as accepted by members of a speech community.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The paper employs the Cognitive Approach of Semantic Change (Sweetser, 1990) in exploring the semantic properties of pɛ, based on the cognitive-conceptual, environmental, and socio-cultural experiences of the people of Nzema. Data were obtained from primary and secondary sources. The paper demonstrates that the various extended usages have a close relationship with the original meaning of the verb. The paper also finds that the primary sense of pɛ ‘to cut’ evokes several contextual interpretations, such as pɛ awolɛ ‘cut childbearing’ (to stop procreation), pɛ azule ‘cut river’ (to travel overseas), pɛ ɔ nli ‘cut his/her mother’ (to insult one’s mother) among others. We note that the various meaning extensions of the verb are dependent on the context of use and/or communication.

While these are regular processes of the language, both are blocked in the perfective. I show that the blockage is the result of a floating low tone that marks the perfective, and that the floating tone marker explains other anomalous tonal effects in the perfective. I then give an analysis of floating tone prefixes that mark certain tenses/aspects/moods by associating to the subject prefix, thus overwriting the lexical tone of the subject prefix. Finally, I give examples of suffixed floating that mark tense/aspect/mood by associating to verb stems, causing the underlying stem tones to delink. In these tenses/aspects/moods, we find evidence for an underlying L vs. toneless contrast, constituting another phenomenon where, as with floating tones, there is a mismatch between the number of tones and tonebearing units.

Comparative work on Nilotic and other Nilo-Saharan families has shown that these languages have a morphologically tripartite system with marked plurals and a bare root singular, marked singulatives constructed from unmarked collectives, and a replacement pattern with morphologically marked singulars and plurals. Historical comparison of the formatives used to construct the different number categories has proven difficult. A number of little-explored Western Nilotic languages of Bahr el-Ghazal have been in contact with Niger-Congo (predominantly Ubangi) languages and have undergone typological as well as specific grammatical changes. An investigation into the historical and present contact situations is needed in order to shed light on how the number inflection systems of these languages were created historically. Sprachbund phenomena include the diffusion of a ka- plural prefix into the Belanda languages, while a convergence phenomenon whose origin is probably more recent is the gradual loss of suffixing singulatives in the Lwoo languages that are in contact with Niger-Congo, which itself does not use singulatives. Retentions and innovations within the system of, number inflection of certain Lwoo languages of Bahr el-Ghazal are discussed and analysed in terms of the history of these languages.

Whereas in other languages the conjoint/disjoint alternation is usually marked by segmental morphology in at least one tense, Rukiga is unique in showing only tonal reduction. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that tonal reduction in Rukiga is not merely a phonological rule, but it encodes the conjoint/disjoint alternation.

According to Payne (1997: 312), clause-chaining has been documented for languages in the highlands of New Guinea, Australia and the Americas. In Africa it is found in Ethiopia (Völlmin et al. 2007), in Kiswahili, a Bantu language (Hopper 1979: 213-215, Mungania 2018), in Anuak, a Western Nilotic language (Longacre 1990: 88-90 and 2007: 418) and in Toposa, a VSO language of South Sudan (Schröder 2011). Clause-chaining is characterized by a long combination of non-finite clauses that have operator dependency on a finite clause, and it usually signals foregrounded information in discourse (see also Dooley 2010: 3). Besides its discourse function, clause-chaining exhibits morpho-syntactic and semantic properties as demonstrated in this paper with examples from Toposa, an Eastern Nilotic language.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

In addition to providing an overview of the complementation strategies in Ruuli, parallels will be drawn to constructions described for related languages as well as common cross-linguistic patterns in clausal complementation. Ruuli employs several different complementation strategies, including indicative, subjunctive, and infinitive constructions. Complement clauses can be either unmarked or marked with a complementizer, the most common of which is nti. These two options are also available for direct speech. Other less common complementizers, which cannot be used to introduce direct speech complements include oba, nga and ni. As individual complement-taking predicates do not allow for every complementation strategy, we will explore the semantic and morphosyntactic conditions which predict the choice of complement. To this end, we consider several predictors. We investigate the restrictions imposed by various complement-taking predicate types, e.g. knowledge predicates, phasal predicates and utterance predicates. Then we consider whether the complement expresses a proposition (a truth-valued meaning unit) or a state-of-affairs (a non-truth valued meaning unit) and whether the subject arguments in the two clauses are identical.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Little has been written on this topic, other than simple descriptions of the facts. I argue that sita 'six' and saba 'seven' were borrowed to replace the existing Bantu forms because they fit better into the pattern of disyllabic words found in the Kiswahili numbers from 1 to 10.

We show that any synchronic analysis which assumes a two-way tonal distinction for each Tone Bearing Unit (e.g., H vs. L, or H vs. ¢) cannot predict the attested number of surface tonal patterns. We avoid this dilemma by proposing that the final mora of certain noun roots is extraprosodic. This assumption not only correctly predicts the attested surface patterns, but results in rules which are well-motivated both theoretically and typologically (in Bantu). We argue that lexical conditioning of extraprosodicity is a natural outgrowth of prosodic theory, parallel to the use of lexical stress and lexical accent.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

These languages differ from their nearest Kwa group relatives in that they have active systems of noun classes and concord. Avatime has 13 noun classes, each with a distinct nominal prefix. Prefixes (as well as most other affixes) agree in [ATR] vowel harmony with the host noun root. Some classes impose invariable low tone on the prefix while prefix tone of other classes may be any of three lexically determined tones. Definiteness is marked by a set of suffixes. The ultimate segmental shapes and tones of these suffixes depend on the interaction of the respective class prefix shapes and coalescence phenomena with stem final vowels. There are correlations between noun class and nominal semantics, and nominal derivation is done in part through class choice. A number of attributive modifiers show class concord with the head noun. In the variety of Avatime studied here, such concord is only though vocalic prefixes on attributive modifiers, not by full CV prefixes as is typical of Bantu languages. Some attributives also have ""tonal concord"", which is not class concord per se, but refers to the tone of the head noun's prefix.

Although Stallcup [1978] tentatively analyzed these sequences as heterosyllabic clusters, the evidence suggests that they are actually prenasalized syllable onsets. First, the distribution of NCs closely parallels that of unambiguous onsets: they occur both initially and medially in words of several grammatical categories. Instances of unambiguous heterosyllabic clusters, by contrast, are rare. Second, while the nasal portion of noun-initial NCs was historically a prefix, it appears to be part of the root synchronically. Third, the nasal portion of an Niger-Congo does not appear to be phonologically tone-bearing.

I show that the core difference lies in the fact that whereas Selective Copy favors prosodic templates, Exhaustive Copy selects parameters defined in terms of prosodic units. This distinction is examined against Swati diminutive reduplication which shows the base-independent vowel a. Crucially, to insert a requires access to segmentally unspecified prosodic units. Under Selective Copy, prosodic templates provide exactly the structures for defining insertion. In contrast, Exhaustive Copy cannot provide an internally consistent mechanism to express a insertion, with its reliance on parameters. This incapability reveals a larger problem confronting Exhaustive Copy: how to account for reduplication involving base expansion rather than base reduction. Unless a mechanism is found, Exhaustive Copy, with its parameter approach, is unable to explain base-expansion cases in reduplication.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

However, although Chomsky does not question the existence of Raising to Subject, which he subsumes under the general rule of NP movement, he seems to strongly reject the rule of Raising to Object, claiming that what this rule does can easily be carried out by means of one of his constraints, the ""Tensed S Constraint"". The goals of the present paper are twofold: the one hand, it aims to show that although Chomsky considers Raising to Subject as an essentially movement rule, this rule seems to operate in Berber without syntactic movement. On the other hand, the paper aims to show that Chomsky's theoretical suggestions in the domain of Raising to Object are highly questionable, if not utterly wrong.

Most inflectional and derivational suffixes in Hausa, e.g. noun plurals and verbal grades, are tone integrating. Tone non-integrating affixes include a few suffixes, e.g. :waa ""participial"" and -aa ""feminine"", and the prefixes ba- ""ethnonymic"" and ma- ""agential/instrumental/locational"".

In many regards, Rangi exhibits the morphosyntax typically associated with East African Bantu: SVO word order, an extensive system of agreement and predominantly head-marking morphology. However, the language also exhibits a number of features which are unusual from a comparative and typological perspective, and which may have resulted from language contact. Four of these features are examined in detail in this paper: 1) Verb-auxiliary order found in the future tense, 2) clause-final negation, 3) a three-way distinction in verbal deictic markers, and 4) an inclusive/exclusive distinction in personal possessive pronouns. These features are assessed with reference to three criteria: syntactic structure, lexical/morphological form and geographic distribution. The examination shows that two of the unusual features result from a combination of internal and external factors, while the other two appear not to be related to external influence through contact.

The qualitative and quantitative corpus study, enhanced by evidence provided by Kituba native speakers, demonstrates the following: although ti spans most parts of the typological map of the polysemy of conjunctive coordinators, its center of prototypicality is located in the initial stage (comitative) and two intermediate stages (possessive and certain types of coordinate-hood) available along the grammaticalization pathway underlying the map. This suggests a semi-advanced grammaticalization profile for ti. The study also proposes certain changes in the typological map of the polysemy of conjunctive coordinators, postulating new components of the map (or grammaticalization stages), and alternative linking directions. Additionally, a possible manner of introducing quantitative data (related to prototypicality) to the qualitative map of polysemy is presented.

In Bilugu Opo, NOMINAL NUMBER marking is divided along the animacy hierarchy into two systems. The TOP SYSTEM, encompassing all human referents, marks singular ~ plural opposition via a variety of morphological strategies (lexical, derivational, and inflectional) and patterns (marked plural, marked singular, and both marked). The SECOND SYSTEM, encompassing all non-human referents, encodes GENERAL NUMBER. In the Opo verb system, VERBAL NUMBER (Corbett 2000) or PLURACTIONALITY (Newman 1990) is attested for just under half of verbs. These verbs can be organized into two groups: a large group which derive a plural stem through morpho-phonemic means (tone modification, vowel gemination, and reduplication) with unpredictable semantics, and a small group which derive a plural stem through lexical means (suppletion and stem alternation) with more predictable semantics.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Rather, verb roots are analyzed as being underlyingly /H, L/, and two additional morphological elements – verbal extensions and TAM prefixes – both reveal a ternary /H, -L, -∅/ contrast. In toneless extensions, this resolves an adjacency issue with regard to polarity of the TAM suffix, while the three floating tonal TAM prefixes either block, pre-empt or permit L tone spread from the subject pronoun onto the stem. The result is an integrated analysis of derivational and inflectional forms that dovetails with a previous analysis of the associative noun phrase.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

I discuss four strategies that are used to negate transitive sentences in Zulu. The default strategy, in which an object marker is added to the negated verb, expresses polarity focus by dislocating the object-marked object from the VP-focus domain. In the second strategy, no object marker occurs, and focus falls on the object or the VP. I show that in this strategy, negation typically associates with the focus and is not part of the presupposition, and I argue that this is responsible for a (hitherto unexplained) additional contrastive inference that speakers report with this negation strategy. The third strategy, a cleft, is used to remove the focused object from the scope of negation; as a result, negation can associate with the presupposition. In the fourth strategy, the object noun loses its augment and is interpreted as a negative polarity item (NPI). Based on a proposal by Lahiri (1998), I argue that in negated sentences with NPI-objects, focus is placed on an implicit cardinality predicate which is associated with the semantic representation of the indefinite NPI-object.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

It is widely acknowledged in the literature that imbrication in Bantu languages is mainly triggered by the perfective or past tense suffix (Bastin 1983). In Lunda, however, this morphophonological process is not only conditioned by the remote past tense inflectional suffix but also caused by derivational extensions that include the applicative, the causative, and to a lesser extent the reciprocal affix when they are attached to a large number of verb bases. Imbrication typically occurs with verb bases containing what is known as an extension, whether productive or frozen. Unlike many Bantu languages, this phenomenon always results in the deletion of the base final consonant and the consonant of the suffix survives. This segmental loss leads to either vowel coalescence between the two adjacent vowels or gliding",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

We observe that the subject marker (SM) that doubles the subject is sometimes obligatory, sometimes optional and sometimes prohibited. We argue that it is the referentiality of the subject that controls the distribution of the SM in Awing, rather than factors such as its morpho-syntactic features or its information structural status, which have been identified to govern argument doubling in a number of other languages with a similar phenomenon. The empirical evidence leads us to conclude that the SM is a pronominal element in Awing rather than an agreement marker. When it occurs, it functions as the argument of the verb and the associated subject NP is base-generated in the left periphery of the clause; when it is absent, the NP is the verbal argument. Awing thus qualifies as a pronominal argument language in the sense of Jelinek (1984); Bresnan and Mchombo (1987); Baker (1996).",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Common to all studies on nominal classification in Kusaal is the observation that nouns that exhibit common morphological properties also share identical semantic features. Though this is true to some extent, the generalization breeds a lot of leakages because classifications based on semantic field alone is unable to explain the inclusion of nouns that share identical morphological and phonological features but different semantic features. Thus, this problem questions the assumption that noun classification in Kusaal is dependent on common semantic properties or coherence shared by all nouns in a group. The semantic classification of nouns, in this study, is composed based on the assumption that speakers of Kusaal put together nouns that are connected by identical semantic features and others that are linked by pragmatic associations into networks that define concepts and aspects of their survival as human beings. It is further observed that nouns within such groups also go through identical phonological rules or constraints. Nouns in this paper are classified based on their morphological features which are closely knit to their semantic networks as well as phonological constraints. The framework of Lexical-Phonology is employed in analyzing the morphophonological components of the nominal classification system of the language",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The k- and má-morphemes are distinguished based on mood. The k-morpheme is used in realis mood while the má-morpheme is used in irrealis mood. Kìí, kò, and kọ́, which are taken to be allomorphs of the k-morpheme, are distinguished based on aspect and focus. It is shown that when the SN markers occur in a different modal-aspectual environment, this generally gives rise to the kind of form-interpretation mismatches described for functional items in Carlson (2006).",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

In monosyllabic words the morphology is manifested solely by alternations among values of a number of phonological parameters of the root, including, among others, vowel length, voice quality, and tone. In this article the alternations of these three parameters are systematically set forth and described for the core of the derivational and inflectional morphology of transitive verbal roots in the Agar dialect of Dinka. Furthermore, it is argued that morphologically complex monosyllabic verb forms are analysable as configurations of morphological layers at which values of the phonological parameters are specified, such configurations being underlying phonological representations.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

The study of pragmatic roles in Central Somali is especially interesting because clause-level focus is explicitly marked through the particle yaa. The functions of this particle in elicitation question-answer pairs and narrative discourse are compared, and it is shown that elicitation data exhibit only a few of the possible functions of yaa, viz. as a marker of assertive and contrastive focus. In contrast, narrative discourse provides examples of yaa as a marker of both event-clause focus and discourse topic. This result is discussed within the context of discourse coherence and is shown to be not as surprising as it first appears. In addition, narrative focus constructions (defined as the most salient section of new information in a narrative text) are shown to be formally well-defined and functionally important in giving coherence to a narrative, although no counterpart has been found in elicitation data. In conclusion, it is noted that pragmatic roles should be studied in a broad range of discourse genres in addition to elicited question-answer data, since each genre may illustrate different functions of the same constructions.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Topicalization typically concerns phrasal categories while subordination typically concerns clausal categories. However, in Zulgo the particle ka, which is clearly used to mark a topicalized phrasal element, can also be used to mark clausal elements which at first glance appear to be cases of subordination. Close consideration of these clausal cases suggests that in fact these are also cases of topicalization. This conclusion is based on the notion of what constitutes a ""reasonable topic"". Zulgo has extended the notion of topicalization across the syntactic categorial boundaries to include constructions which would in other languages be marked by subordinating markers.

From the wider perspective of Niger-Congo, certain of these nouns undoubtedly reconstruct to a level higher than Narrow Bantu.

The pathway toward subject case marking appears to have begun with the demonstrative construction becoming associated with topical referents in discourse. In three of the four Mao languages, the prenominal demonstrative then became associated with definiteness (a typologically common development from topic-marking devices); in those same three languages the frequent co-association between topics and grammatical subjects led to the postnominal form developing subject case marking status. The prenominal definite marker (the erstwhile demonstrative) eventually became emancipated from the postnominal case marker to various degrees across the Mao group. The degree to which subject-development and emancipation between the prenominal and postnominal portions of this demonstrative construction has become established in each of the languages has led to the diverse patterns across the subgroup.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS

Globally, Kambaata has a system of two opposing temperature values, ‘cold’ vs. ‘warm/hot’. The lexeme iib- ‘be(come) warm/hot’ contrasts with caal- ‘be(come) tactile cold’ in the tactile frame of temperature evaluation, while it contrasts with gid- ‘be(come) non-tactile cold’ in the domain of ambient (weather) and personal-feeling (inner) temperature. In addition to these central lexemes, Kambaata has a number of terms that are semantically more restricted, are less frequent and/or have an unequivocal positive or negative connotation, including, e.g., sigg- ‘be(come) comfortably cold or warm, cool’ and buss- ‘burn (tr.); be dangerously, excessively hot’. Irrespective of the temperature value, the expression of personal-feeling temperature is constructionally different from that of ambient temperature and tactile temperature; for the former a transitive, for the latter an intransitive construction is used. As for the extended uses of temperature terms, Kambaata maps warmth/heat onto freshness, busyness, and anger, and links burning heat to anger, spiciness and raging thirst. Unlike many other languages in the world, Kambaata does not relate warmth/heat to affection. Furthermore, Kambaata conceptualizes inactivity, ineptness and fear as tactile cold but the absence of emotional and physical pain as non-tactile cold. Coolness is linked metaphorically to calmness and absence of thirst. In the Highland East Cushitic branch of languages, ‘warm/hot’ is the most stable term, whereas six seemingly non-cognate roots are used for ‘tactile cold’ and/or ‘non-tactile cold'.",STUDIES IN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS
